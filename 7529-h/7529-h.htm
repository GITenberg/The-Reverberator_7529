    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess my daughter&rsquo;s in here,&rdquo; the old man said leading the way into the
      little salon de lecture. He was not of the most advanced age, but that is
      the way George Flack considered him, and indeed he looked older than he
      was. George Flack had found him sitting in the court of the hotel&mdash;he
      sat a great deal in the court of the hotel&mdash;and had gone up to him
      with characteristic directness and asked him for Miss Francina. Poor Mr.
      Dosson had with the greatest docility disposed himself to wait on the
      young man: he had as a matter of course risen and made his way across the
      court to announce to his child that she had a visitor. He looked
      submissive, almost servile, as he preceded the visitor, thrusting his head
      forward in his quest; but it was not in Mr. Flack&rsquo;s line to notice that
      sort of thing. He accepted the old gentleman&rsquo;s good offices as he would
      have accepted those of a waiter, conveying no hint of an attention paid
      also to himself. An observer of these two persons would have assured
      himself that the degree to which Mr. Dosson thought it natural any one
      should want to see his daughter was only equalled by the degree to which
      the young man thought it natural her father should take trouble to produce
      her. There was a superfluous drapery in the doorway of the salon de
      lecture, which Mr. Dosson pushed aside while George Flack stepped in after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading-room of the Hotel de l&rsquo;Univers et de Cheltenham was none too
      ample, and had seemed to Mr. Dosson from the first to consist principally
      of a highly-polished floor on the bareness of which it was easy for a
      relaxed elderly American to slip. It was composed further, to his
      perception, of a table with a green velvet cloth, of a fireplace with a
      great deal of fringe and no fire, of a window with a great deal of curtain
      and no light, and of the Figaro, which he couldn&rsquo;t read, and the New York
      Herald, which he had already read. A single person was just now in
      possession of these conveniences&mdash;a young lady who sat with her back
      to the window, looking straight before her into the conventional room. She
      was dressed as for the street; her empty hands rested upon the arms of her
      chair&mdash;she had withdrawn her long gloves, which were lying in her lap&mdash;and
      she seemed to be doing nothing as hard as she could. Her face was so much
      in shadow as to be barely distinguishable; nevertheless the young man had
      a disappointed cry as soon as he saw her. &ldquo;Why, it ain&rsquo;t Miss Francie&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      Miss Delia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess we can fix that,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson, wandering further into
      the room and drawing his feet over the floor without lifting them.
      Whatever he did he ever seemed to wander: he had an impermanent transitory
      air, an aspect of weary yet patient non-arrival, even when he sat, as he
      was capable of sitting for hours, in the court of the inn. As he glanced
      down at the two newspapers in their desert of green velvet he raised a
      hopeless uninterested glass to his eye. &ldquo;Delia dear, where&rsquo;s your little
      sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delia made no movement whatever, nor did any expression, so far as could
      be perceived, pass over her large young face. She only ejaculated: &ldquo;Why,
      Mr. Flack, where did you drop from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is a good place to meet,&rdquo; her father remarked, as if mildly,
      and as a mere passing suggestion, to deprecate explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any place is good where one meets old friends,&rdquo; said George Flack,
      looking also at the newspapers. He examined the date of the American sheet
      and then put it down. &ldquo;Well, how do you like Paris?&rdquo; he subsequently went
      on to the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We quite enjoy it; but of course we&rsquo;re familiar now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was in hopes I could show you something,&rdquo; Mr. Flack said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ve seen most everything,&rdquo; Mr. Dosson observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve seen more than you!&rdquo; exclaimed his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve seen a good deal&mdash;just sitting there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A person with delicate ear might have suspected Mr. Dosson of a tendency
      to &ldquo;setting&rdquo;; but he would pronounce the same word in a different manner
      at different times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in Paris you can see everything,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite
      enthusiastic about Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been here before?&rdquo; Miss Delia asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, but it&rsquo;s ever fresh. And how is Miss Francie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right. She has gone upstairs to get something. I guess we&rsquo;re
      going out again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very attractive for the young,&rdquo; Mr. Dosson pleaded to the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;m one of the young. Do you mind if I go with you?&rdquo; Mr. Flack
      continued to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll seem like old times, on the deck,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to the
      Bon Marche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to the Louvre? That&rsquo;s the place for YOU.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just come from there: we&rsquo;ve had quite a morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a good place,&rdquo; the visitor a trifle dryly opined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for some things but it doesn&rsquo;t come up to my idea for others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh they&rsquo;ve seen everything,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson. Then he added: &ldquo;I guess
      I&rsquo;ll go and call Francie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell her to hurry,&rdquo; Miss Delia returned, swinging a glove in each
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows my pace,&rdquo; Mr. Flack remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think she would, the way you raced!&rdquo; the girl returned with
      memories of the Umbria. &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t expect to rush round Paris that
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always rush. I live in a rush. That&rsquo;s the way to get through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I AM through, I guess,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; his daughter declared with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must come round often,&rdquo; he continued to their friend as a
      leave-taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll come round! I&rsquo;ll have to rush, but I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send down Francie.&rdquo; And Francie&rsquo;s father crept away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And please give her some more money!&rdquo; her sister called after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she keep the money?&rdquo; George Flack enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;KEEP it?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson stopped as he pushed aside the portiere. &ldquo;Oh you
      innocent young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s the first time you were ever called innocent!&rdquo; cried Delia,
      left alone with the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I WAS&mdash;before I came to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t see that it has hurt US. We ain&rsquo;t a speck extravagant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you have a right to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any one has a right to be,&rdquo; Miss Dosson returned
      incorruptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, who had seated himself, looked at her a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way you used to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miss Francie&mdash;has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Delia Dosson, beginning to draw on her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion watched her, leaning forward with his elbows on the arms of
      his chair and his hands interlocked. At last he said interrogatively: &ldquo;Bon
      Marche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I got them in a little place I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re Paris anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re Paris. But you can get gloves anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must show me the little place anyhow,&rdquo; Mr. Flack continued sociably.
      And he observed further and with the same friendliness: &ldquo;The old gentleman
      seems all there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh he&rsquo;s the dearest of the dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real gentleman&mdash;of the old stamp,&rdquo; said George Flack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what should you think our father would be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think he&rsquo;d be delighted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is, when we carry out our plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are they&mdash;your plans?&rdquo; asked the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I never tell them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How then does he know whether you carry them out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess he&rsquo;d know it if we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember how secretive you were last year. You kept everything to
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know what I want,&rdquo; the young lady pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her button one of her gloves deftly, using a hairpin released
      from some mysterious office under her bonnet. There was a moment&rsquo;s
      silence, after which they looked up at each other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea you don&rsquo;t
      want me,&rdquo; said George Flack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I do&mdash;as a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all the mean ways of trying to get rid of a man that&rsquo;s the meanest!&rdquo;
       he rang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the meanness when I suppose you&rsquo;re not so ridiculous as to wish
      to be anything more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More to your sister, do you mean&mdash;or to yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister IS myself&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t got any other,&rdquo; said Delia Dosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be idiotic. Are you still in the same business?&rdquo; the girl went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I forget which one I WAS in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, something to do with that newspaper&mdash;don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it isn&rsquo;t that paper any more&mdash;it&rsquo;s a different one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you go round for news&mdash;in the same way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I try to get the people what they want. It&rsquo;s hard work,&rdquo; said the
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose if you didn&rsquo;t some one else would. They will have it,
      won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they will have it.&rdquo; The wants of the people, however, appeared at
      the present moment to interest Mr. Flack less than his own. He looked at
      his watch and remarked that the old gentleman didn&rsquo;t seem to have much
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; the girl asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why with Miss Francie. She&rsquo;s taking her time, or rather, I mean, she&rsquo;s
      taking mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you expect to do anything with her you must give her plenty of
      that,&rdquo; Delia returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right: I&rsquo;ll give her all I have.&rdquo; And Miss Dosson&rsquo;s interlocutor
      leaned back in his chair with folded arms, as to signify how much, if it
      came to that, she might have to count with his patience. But she sat there
      easy and empty, giving no sign and fearing no future. He was the first
      indeed to turn again to restlessness: at the end of a few moments he asked
      the young lady if she didn&rsquo;t suppose her father had told her sister who it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s required?&rdquo; she made answer with cold
      gaiety. But she added more familiarly: &ldquo;Probably that&rsquo;s the reason. She&rsquo;s
      so shy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;she used to look it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s her peculiarity, that she never looks it and yet suffers
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you make it up for her then, Miss Delia,&rdquo; the young man ventured to
      declare. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suffer much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for Francie I&rsquo;m all there. I guess I could act for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a pause. &ldquo;You act for her too much. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you I think I
      could do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got to kill me first!&rdquo; Delia Dosson replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come down on you somehow in the Reverberator&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the threat left her calm. &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s not what the people want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, unfortunately they don&rsquo;t care anything about MY affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we do: we&rsquo;re kinder than most, Francie and I,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;But
      we desire to keep your affairs quite distinct from ours.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Oh your&mdash;yours: if I could only discover what they are!&rdquo; cried
      George Flack. And during the rest of the time that they waited the young
      journalist tried to find out. If an observer had chanced to be present for
      the quarter of an hour that elapsed, and had had any attention to give to
      these vulgar young persons, he would have wondered perhaps at there being
      so much mystery on one side and so much curiosity on the other&mdash;wondered
      at least at the elaboration of inscrutable projects on the part of a girl
      who looked to the casual eye as if she were stolidly passive. Fidelia
      Dosson, whose name had been shortened, was twenty-five years old and had a
      large white face, in which the eyes were far apart. Her forehead was high
      but her mouth was small, her hair was light and colourless and a certain
      inelegant thickness of figure made her appear shorter than she was.
      Elegance indeed had not been her natural portion, and the Bon Marche and
      other establishments had to make up for that. To a casual sister&rsquo;s eye
      they would scarce have appeared to have acquitted themselves of their
      office, but even a woman wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed how little Fidelia cared.
      She always looked the same; all the contrivances of Paris couldn&rsquo;t fill
      out that blank, and she held them, for herself, in no manner of esteem. It
      was a plain clean round pattern face, marked for recognition among so many
      only perhaps by a small figure, the sprig on a china plate, that might
      have denoted deep obstinacy; and yet, with its settled smoothness, it was
      neither stupid nor hard. It was as calm as a room kept dusted and aired
      for candid earnest occasions, the meeting of unanimous committees and the
      discussion of flourishing businesses. If she had been a young man&mdash;and
      she had a little the head of one&mdash;it would probably have been thought
      of her that she was likely to become a Doctor or a Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      An observer would have gathered, further, that Mr. Flack&rsquo;s acquaintance
      with Mr. Dosson and his daughters had had its origin in his crossing the
      Atlantic eastward in their company more than a year before, and in some
      slight association immediately after disembarking, but that each party had
      come and gone a good deal since then&mdash;come and gone however without
      meeting again. It was to be inferred that in this interval Miss Dosson had
      led her father and sister back to their native land and had then a second
      time directed their course to Europe. This was a new departure, said Mr.
      Flack, or rather a new arrival: he understood that it wasn&rsquo;t, as he called
      it, the same old visit. She didn&rsquo;t repudiate the accusation, launched by
      her companion as if it might have been embarrassing, of having spent her
      time at home in Boston, and even in a suburban quarter of it: she
      confessed that as Bostonians they had been capable of that. But now they
      had come abroad for longer&mdash;ever so much: what they had gone home for
      was to make arrangements for a European stay of which the limits were not
      to be told. So far as this particular future opened out to her she freely
      acknowledged it. It appeared to meet with George Flack&rsquo;s approval&mdash;he
      also had a big undertaking on that side and it might require years, so
      that it would be pleasant to have his friends right there. He knew his way
      round in Paris&mdash;or any place like that&mdash;much better than round
      Boston; if they had been poked away in one of those clever suburbs they
      would have been lost to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, you&rsquo;ll see as much as you want of us&mdash;the way you&rsquo;ll have
      to take us,&rdquo; Delia Dosson said: which led the young man to ask which that
      way was and to guess he had never known but one way to take anything&mdash;which
      was just as it came. &ldquo;Oh well, you&rsquo;ll see what you&rsquo;ll make of it,&rdquo; the
      girl returned; and she would give for the present no further explanation
      of her somewhat chilling speech. In spite if it however she professed an
      interest in Mr. Flack&rsquo;s announced undertaking&mdash;an interest springing
      apparently from an interest in the personage himself. The man of
      wonderments and measurements we have smuggled into the scene would have
      gathered that Miss Dosson&rsquo;s attention was founded on a conception of Mr.
      Flack&rsquo;s intrinsic brilliancy. Would his own impression have justified
      that?&mdash;would he have found such a conception contagious? I forbear to
      ridicule the thought, for that would saddle me with the care of showing
      what right our officious observer might have had to his particular
      standard. Let us therefore simply note that George Flack had grounds for
      looming publicly large to an uninformed young woman. He was connected, as
      she supposed, with literature, and wasn&rsquo;t a sympathy with literature one
      of the many engaging attributes of her so generally attractive little
      sister? If Mr. Flack was a writer Francie was a reader: hadn&rsquo;t a trail of
      forgotten Tauchnitzes marked the former line of travel of the party of
      three? The elder girl grabbed at them on leaving hotels and
      railway-carriages, but usually found that she had brought odd volumes. She
      considered however that as a family they had an intellectual link with the
      young journalist, and would have been surprised if she had heard the
      advantage of his acquaintance questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flack&rsquo;s appearance was not so much a property of his own as a
      prejudice or a fixed liability of those who looked at him: whoever they
      might be what they saw mainly in him was that they had seen him before.
      And, oddly enough, this recognition carried with it in general no ability
      to remember&mdash;that is to recall&mdash;him: you couldn&rsquo;t conveniently
      have prefigured him, and it was only when you were conscious of him that
      you knew you had already somehow paid for it. To carry him in your mind
      you must have liked him very much, for no other sentiment, not even
      aversion, would have taught you what distinguished him in his group:
      aversion in especial would have made you aware only of what confounded
      him. He was not a specific person, but had beyond even Delia Dosson, in
      whom we have facially noted it, the quality of the sample or
      advertisement, the air of representing a &ldquo;line of goods&rdquo; for which there
      is a steady popular demand. You would scarce have expected him to be
      individually designated: a number, like that of the day&rsquo;s newspaper, would
      have served all his, or at least all your purpose, and you would have
      vaguely supposed the number high&mdash;somewhere up in the millions. As
      every copy of the newspaper answers to its name, Miss Dosson&rsquo;s visitor
      would have been quite adequately marked as &ldquo;young commercial American.&rdquo;
       Let me add that among the accidents of his appearance was that of its
      sometimes striking other young commercial Americans as fine. He was
      twenty-seven years old and had a small square head, a light grey overcoat
      and in his right forefinger a curious natural crook which might have
      availed, under pressure, to identify him. But for the convenience of
      society he ought always to have worn something conspicuous&mdash;a green
      hat or a yellow necktie. His undertaking was to obtain material in Europe
      for an American &ldquo;society-paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If it be objected to all this that when Francie Dosson at last came in she
      addressed him as if she easily placed him, the answer is that she had been
      notified by her father&mdash;and more punctually than was indicated by the
      manner of her response. &ldquo;Well, the way you DO turn up,&rdquo; she said, smiling
      and holding out her left hand to him: in the other hand, or the hollow of
      her slim right arm, she had a lumpish parcel. Though she had made him wait
      she was clearly very glad to see him there; and she as evidently required
      and enjoyed a great deal of that sort of indulgence. Her sister&rsquo;s attitude
      would have told you so even if her own appearance had not. There was that
      in her manner to the young man&mdash;a perceptible but indefinable shade&mdash;which
      seemed to legitimate the oddity of his having asked in particular for her,
      asked as if he wished to see her to the exclusion of her father and
      sister: the note of a special pleasure which might have implied a special
      relation. And yet a spectator looking from Mr. George Flack to Miss
      Francie Dosson would have been much at a loss to guess what special
      relation could exist between them. The girl was exceedingly,
      extraordinarily pretty, all exempt from traceable likeness to her sister;
      and there was a brightness in her&mdash;a still and scattered radiance&mdash;which
      was quite distinct from what is called animation. Rather tall than short,
      fine slender erect, with an airy lightness of hand and foot, she yet gave
      no impression of quick movement, of abundant chatter, of excitable nerves
      and irrepressible life&mdash;no hint of arriving at her typical American
      grace in the most usual way. She was pretty without emphasis and as might
      almost have been said without point, and your fancy that a little
      stiffness would have improved her was at once qualified by the question of
      what her softness would have made of it. There was nothing in her,
      however, to confirm the implication that she had rushed about the deck of
      a Cunarder with a newspaper-man. She was as straight as a wand and as true
      as a gem; her neck was long and her grey eyes had colour; and from the
      ripple of her dark brown hair to the curve of her unaffirmative chin every
      line in her face was happy and pure. She had a weak pipe of a voice and
      inconceivabilities of ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia got up, and they came out of the little reading-room&mdash;this
      young lady remarking to her sister that she hoped she had brought down all
      the things. &ldquo;Well, I had a fiendish hunt for them&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got so
      many,&rdquo; Francie replied with a strange want of articulation. &ldquo;There were a
      few dozens of the pocket-handkerchiefs I couldn&rsquo;t find; but I guess I&rsquo;ve
      got most of them and most of the gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you carting them about for?&rdquo; George Flack enquired, taking
      the parcel from her. &ldquo;You had better let me handle them. Do you buy
      pocket-handkerchiefs by the hundred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it only makes fifty apiece,&rdquo; Francie yieldingly smiled. &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t
      really nice&mdash;we&rsquo;re going to change them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I won&rsquo;t be mixed up with that&mdash;you can&rsquo;t work that game on these
      Frenchmen!&rdquo; the young man stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh with Francie they&rsquo;ll take anything back,&rdquo; Delia Dosson declared. &ldquo;They
      just love her, all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re like me then,&rdquo; said Mr. Flack with friendly cheer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;LL
      take her back if she&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready quite yet,&rdquo; the girl replied. &ldquo;But I hope
      very much we shall cross with you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk about crossing&mdash;it&rsquo;s on these boulevards we want a
      life-preserver!&rdquo; Delia loudly commented. They had passed out of the hotel
      and the wide vista of the Rue de la Paix stretched up and down. There were
      many vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t this thing do? I&rsquo;ll tie it to either of you,&rdquo; George Flack said,
      holding out his bundle. &ldquo;I suppose they won&rsquo;t kill you if they love you,&rdquo;
       he went on to the object of his preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got to know me first,&rdquo; she answered, laughing and looking
      for a chance, while they waited to pass over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you when I was struck.&rdquo; He applied his disengaged hand to
      her elbow and propelled her across the street. She took no notice of his
      observation, and Delia asked her, on the other side, whether their father
      had given her that money. She replied that he had given her loads&mdash;she
      felt as if he had made his will; which led George Flack to say that he
      wished the old gentleman was HIS father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why you don&rsquo;t mean to say you want to be our brother!&rdquo; Francie prattled
      as they went down the Rue de la Paix.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to be Miss Delia&rsquo;s, if you can make that out,&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then suppose you prove it by calling me a cab,&rdquo; Miss Delia returned.
      &ldquo;I presume you and Francie don&rsquo;t take this for a promenade-deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t she feel rich?&rdquo; George Flack demanded of Francie. &ldquo;But we do
      require a cart for our goods&rdquo;; and he hailed a little yellow carriage,
      which presently drew up beside the pavement. The three got into it and,
      still emitting innocent pleasantries, proceeded on their way, while at the
      Hotel de l&rsquo;Univers et de Cheltenham Mr. Dosson wandered down into the
      court again and took his place in his customary chair.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The court was roofed with glass; the April air was mild; the cry of women
      selling violets came in from the street and, mingling with the rich hum of
      Paris, seemed to bring with it faintly the odour of the flowers. There
      were other odours in the place, warm succulent and Parisian, which ranged
      from fried fish to burnt sugar; and there were many things besides: little
      tables for the post-prandial coffee; piles of luggage inscribed (after the
      initials or frequently the name) R. P. Scudamore or D. Jackson Hodge,
      Philadelphia Pa., or St. Louis Mo.; rattles of unregarded bells, flittings
      of tray-bearing waiters, conversations with the second-floor windows of
      admonitory landladies, arrivals of young women with coffinlike bandboxes
      covered with black oil-cloth and depending from a strap, sallyings-forth
      of persons staying and arrivals just afterwards of other persons to see
      them; together with vague prostrations on benches of tired heads of
      American families. It was to this last element that Mr. Dosson himself in
      some degree contributed, but it must be added that he had not the
      extremely bereft and exhausted appearance of certain of his fellows. There
      was an air of ruminant resignation, of habitual accommodation in him; but
      you would have guessed that he was enjoying a holiday rather than aching
      for a truce, and he was not so enfeebled but that he was able to get up
      from time to time and stroll through the porte cochere to have a look at
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed up and down for five minutes with his hands in his pockets, and
      then came back; that appeared to content him; he asked for little and had
      no restlessness that these small excursions wouldn&rsquo;t assuage. He looked at
      the heaped-up luggage, at the tinkling bells, at the young women from the
      lingere, at the repudiated visitors, at everything but the other American
      parents. Something in his breast told him that he knew all about these.
      It&rsquo;s not upon each other that the animals in the same cage, in a
      zoological collection, most turn their eyes. There was a silent
      sociability in him and a superficial fineness of grain that helped to
      account for his daughter Francie&rsquo;s various delicacies. He was fair and
      spare and had no figure; you would have seen in a moment that the question
      of how he should hold himself had never in his life occurred to him. He
      never held himself at all; providence held him rather&mdash;and very
      loosely&mdash;by an invisible string at the end of which he seemed gently
      to dangle and waver. His face was so smooth that his thin light whiskers,
      which grew only far back, scarcely seemed native to his cheeks: they might
      have been attached there for some harmless purpose of comedy or disguise.
      He looked for the most part as if he were thinking over, without exactly
      understanding it, something rather droll that had just occurred; if his
      eyes wandered his attention rested, just as it hurried, quite as little.
      His feet were remarkably small, and his clothes, in which light colours
      predominated, were visibly the work of a French tailor: he was an American
      who still held the tradition that it is in Paris a man dresses himself
      best. His hat would have looked odd in Bond Street or the Fifth Avenue,
      and his necktie was loose and flowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dosson, it may further be noted, was a person of the simplest
      composition, a character as cipherable as a sum of two figures. He had a
      native financial faculty of the finest order, a gift as direct as a
      beautiful tenor voice, which had enabled him, without the aid of
      particular strength of will or keenness of ambition, to build up a large
      fortune while he was still of middle age. He had a genius for happy
      speculation, the quick unerring instinct of a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo;; and as he sat
      there idle amused contented, on the edge of the Parisian street, he might
      very well have passed for some rare performer who had sung his song or
      played his trick and had nothing to do till the next call. And he had
      grown rich not because he was ravenous or hard, but simply because he had
      an ear, not to term it a nose. He could make out the tune in the discord
      of the market-place; he could smell success far up the wind. The second
      factor in his little addition was that he was an unassuming father. He had
      no tastes, no acquirements, no curiosities, and his daughters represented
      all society for him. He thought much more and much oftener of these young
      ladies than of his bank-shares and railway-stock; they crowned much more
      his sense of accumulated property. He never compared them with other
      girls; he only compared his present self with what he would have been
      without them. His view of them was perfectly simple. Delia had a greater
      direct knowledge of life and Francie a wider acquaintance with literature
      and art. Mr. Dosson had not perhaps a full perception of his younger
      daughter&rsquo;s beauty: he would scarcely have pretended to judge of that, more
      than he would of a valuable picture or vase, but he believed she was
      cultivated up to the eyes. He had a recollection of tremendous
      school-bills and, in later days, during their travels, of the way she was
      always leaving books behind her. Moreover wasn&rsquo;t her French so good that
      he couldn&rsquo;t understand it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls, at any rate, formed the breeze in his sail and the only
      directing determinant force he knew; when anything happened&mdash;and he
      was under the impression that things DID happen&mdash;they were there for
      it to have happened TO. Without them in short, as he felt, he would have
      been the tail without the kite. The wind rose and fell of course; there
      were lulls and there were gales; there were intervals during which he
      simply floated in quiet waters&mdash;cast anchor and waited. This appeared
      to be one of them now; but he could be patient, knowing that he should
      soon again inhale the brine and feel the dip of his prow. When his
      daughters were out for any time the occasion affected him as a
      &ldquo;weather-breeder&rdquo;&mdash;the wind would be then, as a kind of consequence,
      GOING to rise; but their now being out with a remarkably bright young man
      only sweetened the temporary calm. That belonged to their superior life,
      and Mr. Dosson never doubted that George M. Flack was remarkably bright.
      He represented the newspaper, and the newspaper for this man of genial
      assumptions represented&mdash;well, all other representations whatever. To
      know Delia and Francie thus attended by an editor or a correspondent was
      really to see them dancing in the central glow. This is doubtless why Mr.
      Dosson had slightly more than usual his air of recovering slowly from a
      pleasant surprise. The vision to which I allude hung before him, at a
      convenient distance, and melted into other bright confused aspects:
      reminiscences of Mr. Flack in other relations&mdash;on the ship, on the
      deck, at the hotel at Liverpool, and in the cars. Whitney Dosson was a
      loyal father, but he would have thought himself simple had he not had two
      or three strong convictions: one of which was that the children should
      never go out with a gentleman they hadn&rsquo;t seen before. The sense of their
      having, and his having, seen Mr. Flack before was comfortable to him now:
      it made mere placidity of his personally foregoing the young man&rsquo;s society
      in favour of Delia and Francie. He had not hitherto been perfectly
      satisfied that the streets and shops, the general immensity of Paris, were
      just the safest place for young ladies alone. But the company of a helpful
      gentleman ensured safety&mdash;a gentleman who would be helpful by the
      fact of his knowing so much and having it all right there. If a big
      newspaper told you everything there was in the world every morning, that
      was what a big newspaper-man would have to know, and Mr. Dosson had never
      supposed there was anything left to know when such voices as Mr. Flack&rsquo;s
      and that of his organ had daily been heard. In the absence of such happy
      chances&mdash;and in one way or another they kept occurring&mdash;his
      girls might have seemed lonely, which was not the way he struck himself.
      They were his company but he scarcely theirs; it was as if they belonged
      to him more than he to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were out a long time, but he felt no anxiety, as he reflected that
      Mr. Flack&rsquo;s very profession would somehow make everything turn out to
      their profit. The bright French afternoon waned without bringing them
      back, yet Mr. Dosson still revolved about the court till he might have
      been taken for a valet de place hoping to pick up custom. The landlady
      smiled at him sometimes as she passed and re-passed, and even ventured to
      remark disinterestedly that it was a pity to waste such a lovely day
      indoors&mdash;not to take a turn and see what was going on in Paris. But
      Mr. Dosson had no sense of waste: that came to him much more when he was
      confronted with historical monuments or beauties of nature or art, which
      affected him as the talk of people naming others, naming friends of
      theirs, whom he had never heard of: then he was aware of a degree of waste
      for the others, as if somebody lost something&mdash;but never when he
      lounged in that simplifying yet so comprehensive way in the court. It
      wanted but a quarter of an hour to dinner&mdash;THAT historic fact was not
      beyond his measure&mdash;when Delia and Francie at last met his view,
      still accompanied by Mr. Flack and sauntering in, at a little distance
      from each other, with a jaded air which was not in the least a tribute to
      his possible solicitude. They dropped into chairs and joked with each
      other, mingling sociability and languor, on the subject of what they had
      seen and done&mdash;a question into which he felt as yet the delicacy of
      enquiring. But they had evidently done a good deal and had a good time: an
      impression sufficient to rescue Mr. Dosson personally from the
      consciousness of failure. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you just step in and take dinner with
      us?&rdquo; he asked of the young man with a friendliness to which everything
      appeared to minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a handsome offer,&rdquo; George Flack replied while Delia put it
      on record that they had each eaten about thirty cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wondered what you were doing so long. But never mind your cakes.
      It&rsquo;s twenty minutes past six, and the table d&rsquo;hote&rsquo;s on time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you dine at the table d&rsquo;hote!&rdquo; Mr. Flack cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you like that?&rdquo;&mdash;and Francie&rsquo;s candour of appeal to their
      comrade&rsquo;s taste was celestial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t what you must build on when you come to Paris. Too many
      flowerpots and chickens&rsquo; legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, would you like one of these restaurants?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dosson. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      don&rsquo;t care&mdash;if you show us a good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;ll show you a good one&mdash;don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo; Mr. Flack&rsquo;s tone was
      ever that of keeping the poor gentleman mildly but firmly in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got to order the dinner then,&rdquo; said Francie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see how I could do it!&rdquo; He towered over her in the pride of
      this feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got an interest in some place,&rdquo; Delia declared. &ldquo;He has taken us
      to ever so many stores where he gets his commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d pay you to take them round,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson; and with much
      agreeable trifling of this kind it was agreed that they should sally forth
      for the evening meal under Mr. Flack&rsquo;s guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had easily convinced them on this occasion that that was a more
      original proceeding than worrying those old bones, as he called it, at the
      hotel, he convinced them of other things besides in the course of the
      following month and by the aid of profuse attentions. What he mainly made
      clear to them was that it was really most kind of a young man who had so
      many big things on his mind to find sympathy for questions, for issues, he
      used to call them, that could occupy the telegraph and the press so little
      as theirs. He came every day to set them in the right path, pointing out
      its charms to them in a way that made them feel how much they had been in
      the wrong. It made them feel indeed that they didn&rsquo;t know anything about
      anything, even about such a matter as ordering shoes&mdash;an art in which
      they had vaguely supposed themselves rather strong. He had in fact great
      knowledge, which was wonderfully various, and he knew as many people as
      they knew few. He had appointments&mdash;very often with celebrities&mdash;for
      every hour of the day, and memoranda, sometimes in shorthand, on tablets
      with elastic straps, with which he dazzled the simple folk at the Hotel de
      l&rsquo;Univers et de Cheltenham, whose social life, of narrow range, consisted
      mainly in reading the lists of Americans who &ldquo;registered&rdquo; at the bankers&rsquo; 
      and at Galignani&rsquo;s. Delia Dosson in particular had a trick of poring
      solemnly over these records which exasperated Mr. Flack, who skimmed them
      and found what he wanted in the flash of an eye: she kept the others
      waiting while she satisfied herself that Mr. and Mrs. D. S. Rosenheim and
      Miss Cora Rosenheim and Master Samuel Rosenheim had &ldquo;left for Brussels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flack was wonderful on all occasions in finding what he wanted&mdash;which,
      as we know, was what he believed the public wanted&mdash;and Delia was the
      only one of the party with whom he was sometimes a little sharp. He had
      embraced from the first the idea that she was his enemy, and he alluded to
      it with almost tiresome frequency, though always in a humorous fearless
      strain. Even more than by her fashion of hanging over the registers she
      provoked him by appearing to find their little party not sufficient to
      itself, by wishing, as he expressed it, to work in new stuff. He might
      have been easy, however, for he had sufficient chance to observe how it
      was always the fate of the Dossons to miss their friends. They were
      continually looking out for reunions and combinations that never came off,
      hearing that people had been in Paris only after they had gone away, or
      feeling convinced that they were there but not to be found through their
      not having registered, or wondering whether they should overtake them if
      they should go to Dresden, and then making up their minds to start for
      Dresden only to learn at the eleventh hour, through some accident, that
      the hunted game had &ldquo;left for&rdquo; Biarritz even as the Rosenheims for
      Brussels. &ldquo;We know plenty of people if we could only come across them,&rdquo;
       Delia had more than once observed: she scanned the Continent with a
      wondering baffled gaze and talked of the unsatisfactory way in which
      friends at home would &ldquo;write out&rdquo; that other friends were &ldquo;somewhere in
      Europe.&rdquo; She expressed the wish that such correspondents as that might be
      in a place that was not at all vague. Two or three times people had called
      at the hotel when they were out and had left cards for them without an
      address and superscribed with some mocking dash of the pencil&mdash;&ldquo;So
      sorry to miss you!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Off to-morrow!&rdquo; The girl sat looking at these
      cards, handling them and turning them over for a quarter of an hour at a
      time; she produced them days afterwards, brooding upon them afresh as if
      they were a mystic clue. George Flack generally knew where they were, the
      people who were &ldquo;somewhere in Europe.&rdquo; Such knowledge came to him by a
      kind of intuition, by the voices of the air, by indefinable and
      unteachable processes. But he held his peace on purpose; he didn&rsquo;t want
      any outsiders; he thought their little party just right. Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s
      place in the scheme of Providence was to &ldquo;go&rdquo; with Delia while he himself
      &ldquo;went&rdquo; with Francie, and nothing would have induced George Flack to
      disfigure that equation. The young man was professionally so occupied with
      other people&rsquo;s affairs that it should doubtless be mentioned to his praise
      that he still managed to have affairs&mdash;or at least an affair&mdash;of
      his own. That affair was Francie Dosson, and he was pleased to perceive
      how little SHE cared what had become of Mr. and Mrs. Rosenheim and Master
      Samuel and Miss Cora. He counted all the things she didn&rsquo;t care about&mdash;her
      soft inadvertent eyes helped him to do that; and they footed up so, as he
      would have said, that they gave him the rich sense of a free field. If she
      had so few interests there was the greater possibility that a young man of
      bold conceptions and cheerful manners might become one. She had usually
      the air of waiting for something, with a pretty listlessness or an amused
      resignation, while tender shy indefinite little fancies hummed in her
      brain. Thus she would perhaps recognise in him the reward of patience.
      George Flack was aware that he exposed his friends to considerable
      fatigue: he brought them back pale and taciturn from suburban excursions
      and from wanderings often rather aimless and casual among the boulevards
      and avenues of the town. He regarded them at such times with complacency
      however, for these were hours of diminished resistance: he had an idea
      that he should be able eventually to circumvent Delia if he only could
      catch her some day sufficiently, that is physically, prostrate. He liked
      to make them all feel helpless and dependent, and this was not difficult
      with people who were so modest and artless, so unconscious of the
      boundless power of wealth. Sentiment, in our young man, was not a scruple
      nor a source of weakness; but he thought it really touching, the little
      these good people knew of what they could do with their money. They had in
      their hands a weapon of infinite range and yet were incapable of firing a
      shot for themselves. They had a sort of social humility; it appeared never
      to have occurred to them that, added to their loveliness, their money gave
      them a value. This used to strike George Flack on certain occasions when
      he came back to find them in the places where he had dropped them while he
      rushed off to give a turn to one of his screws. They never played him
      false, never wearied of waiting; always sat patient and submissive,
      usually at a cafe to which he had introduced them or in a row of chairs on
      the boulevard, on the level expanse of the Tuileries or in the Champs
      Elysees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He introduced them to many cafes, in different parts of Paris, being
      careful to choose those which in his view young ladies might frequent with
      propriety, and there were two or three in the neighbourhood of their hotel
      where they became frequent and familiar figures. As the late spring days
      grew warmer and brighter they mainly camped out on the &ldquo;terrace,&rdquo; amid the
      array of small tables at the door of the establishment, where Mr. Flack,
      on the return, could descry them from afar at their post and in the very
      same postures to which he had appointed them. They complained of no
      satiety in watching the many-coloured movement of the Parisian streets;
      and if some of the features in the panorama were base they were only so in
      a version that the social culture of our friends was incapable of
      supplying. George Flack considered that he was rendering a positive
      service to Mr. Dosson: wouldn&rsquo;t the old gentleman have sat all day in the
      court anyway? and wasn&rsquo;t the boulevard better than the court? It was his
      theory too that he nattered and caressed Miss Francie&rsquo;s father, for there
      was no one to whom he had furnished more copious details about the
      affairs, the projects and prospects, of the Reverberator. He had left no
      doubt in the old gentleman&rsquo;s mind as to the race he himself intended to
      run, and Mr. Dosson used to say to him every day, the first thing, &ldquo;Well,
      where have you got to now?&rdquo;&mdash;quite as if he took a real interest.
      George Flack reported his interviews, that is his reportings, to which
      Delia and Francie gave attention only in case they knew something of the
      persons on whom the young emissary of the Reverberator had conferred this
      distinction; whereas Mr. Dosson listened, with his tolerant interposition
      of &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; just as submissively when he
      heard of the celebrity in question for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conversation with his daughters Mr. Flack was frequently the theme,
      though introduced much more by the young ladies than by himself, and
      especially by Delia, who announced at an early period that she knew what
      he wanted and that it wasn&rsquo;t in the least what SHE wanted. She amplified
      this statement very soon&mdash;at least as regards her interpretation of
      Mr. Flack&rsquo;s designs: a certain mystery still hung about her own, which, as
      she intimated, had much more to recommend them. Delia&rsquo;s vision of the
      danger as well as the advantage of being a pretty girl was closely
      connected, as was natural, with the idea of an &ldquo;engagement&rdquo;: this idea was
      in a manner complete in itself&mdash;her imagination failed in the oddest
      way to carry it into the next stage. She wanted her sister to be engaged
      but wanted her not at all to be married, and had clearly never made up her
      mind as to how Francie was to enjoy both the peril and the shelter. It was
      a secret source of humiliation to her that there had as yet to her
      knowledge been no one with whom her sister had exchanged vows; if her
      conviction on this subject could have expressed itself intelligibly it
      would have given you a glimpse of a droll state of mind&mdash;a dim theory
      that a bright girl ought to be able to try successive aspirants. Delia&rsquo;s
      conception of what such a trial might consist of was strangely innocent:
      it was made up of calls and walks and buggy-drives, and above all of
      being, in the light of these exhibitions, the theme of tongues and subject
      to the great imputation. It had never in life occurred to her withal that
      a succession of lovers, or just even a repetition of experiments, may have
      anything to say to a young lady&rsquo;s delicacy. She felt herself a born old
      maid and never dreamed of a lover of her own&mdash;he would have been
      dreadfully in her way; but she dreamed of love as something in its nature
      essentially refined. All the same she discriminated; it did lead to
      something after all, and she desired that for Francie it shouldn&rsquo;t lead to
      a union with Mr. Flack. She looked at such a union under the influence of
      that other view which she kept as yet to herself but was prepared to
      produce so soon as the right occasion should come up; giving her sister to
      understand that she would never speak to her again should this young man
      be allowed to suppose&mdash;! Which was where she always paused, plunging
      again into impressive reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To suppose what?&rdquo; Francie would ask as if she were totally unacquainted&mdash;which
      indeed she really was&mdash;with the suppositions of young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see&mdash;when he begins to say things you won&rsquo;t like!&rdquo; This
      sounded ominous on Delia&rsquo;s part, yet her anxiety was really but thin:
      otherwise she would have risen against the custom adopted by Mr. Flack of
      perpetually coming round. She would have given her attention&mdash;though
      it struggled in general unsuccessfully with all this side of their life&mdash;to
      some prompt means of getting away from Paris. She expressed to her father
      what in her view the correspondent of the Reverberator was &ldquo;after&rdquo;; but
      without, it must be added, gaining from him the sense of it as a connexion
      in which he could be greatly worked up. This indeed was not of importance,
      thanks to her inner faith that Francie would never really do anything&mdash;that
      is would never really like anything&mdash;her nearest relatives didn&rsquo;t
      like. Her sister&rsquo;s docility was a great comfort to Delia, the more that
      she herself, taking it always for granted, was the first to profit by it.
      She liked and disliked certain things much more than her junior did
      either; and Francie cultivated the convenience of her reasons, having so
      few of her own. They served&mdash;Delia&rsquo;s reasons&mdash;for Mr. Dosson as
      well, so that Francie was not guilty of any particular irreverence in
      regarding her sister rather than her father as the controller of her fate.
      A fate was rather an unwieldy and terrible treasure, which it relieved her
      that some kind person should undertake to administer. Delia had somehow
      got hold of hers first&mdash;before even her father, and ever so much
      before Mr. Flack; and it lay with Delia to make any change. She couldn&rsquo;t
      have accepted any gentleman as a party to an engagement&mdash;which was
      somehow as far as her imagination went&mdash;without reference to Delia,
      any more than she could have done up her hair without a glass. The only
      action taken by Mr. Dosson on his elder daughter&rsquo;s admonitions was to
      convert the general issue, as Mr. Flack would have called it, to a theme
      for daily pleasantry. He was fond, in his intercourse with his children,
      of some small usual joke, some humorous refrain; and what could have been
      more in the line of true domestic sport than a little gentle but
      unintermitted raillery on Francie&rsquo;s conquest? Mr. Flack&rsquo;s attributive
      intentions became a theme of indulgent parental chaff, and the girl was
      neither dazzled nor annoyed by the freedom of all this tribute. &ldquo;Well, he
      HAS told us about half we know,&rdquo; she used to reply with an air of the
      judicious that the undetected observer I am perpetually moved to invoke
      would have found indescribably quaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the items of knowledge for which they were indebted to him floated
      the fact that this was the very best time in the young lady&rsquo;s life to have
      her portrait painted and the best place in the world to have it done well;
      also that he knew a &ldquo;lovely artist,&rdquo; a young American of extraordinary
      talent, who would be delighted to undertake the job. He led his trio to
      this gentleman&rsquo;s studio, where they saw several pictures that opened to
      them the strange gates of mystification. Francie protested that she didn&rsquo;t
      want to be done in THAT style, and Delia declared that she would as soon
      have her sister shown up in a magic lantern. They had had the fortune not
      to find Mr. Waterlow at home, so that they were free to express themselves
      and the pictures were shown them by his servant. They looked at them as
      they looked at bonnets and confections when they went to expensive shops;
      as if it were a question, among so many specimens, of the style and colour
      they would choose. Mr. Waterlow&rsquo;s productions took their place for the
      most part in the category of those creations known to ladies as frights,
      and our friends retired with the lowest opinion of the young American
      master. George Flack told them however that they couldn&rsquo;t get out of it,
      inasmuch as he had already written home to the Reverberator that Francie
      was to sit. They accepted this somehow as a kind of supernatural sign that
      she would have to, for they believed everything they ever heard quoted
      from a newspaper. Moreover Mr. Flack explained to them that it would be
      idiotic to miss such an opportunity to get something at once precious and
      cheap; for it was well known that impressionism was going to be the art of
      the future, and Charles Waterlow was a rising impressionist. It was a new
      system altogether and the latest improvement in art. They didn&rsquo;t want to
      go back, they wanted to go forward, and he would give them an article that
      would fetch five times the money in about five years&mdash;which somehow,
      as he put it, seemed a very short time, though it would have seemed
      immense for anything else. They were not in search of a bargain, but they
      allowed themselves to be inoculated with any reason they thought would be
      characteristic of informed people; and he even convinced them after a
      little that when once they had got used to impressionism they would never
      look at anything else. Mr. Waterlow was the man, among the young, and he
      had no interest in praising him, because he was not a personal friend: his
      reputation was advancing with strides, and any one with any sense would
      want to secure something before the rush.

      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young ladies consented to return to the Avenue des Villiers; and this
      time they found the celebrity of the future. He was smoking cigarettes
      with a friend while coffee was served to the two gentlemen&mdash;it was
      just after luncheon&mdash;on a vast divan covered with scrappy oriental
      rugs and cushions; it looked, Francie thought, as if the artist had set up
      a carpet-shop in a corner. He struck her as very pleasant; and it may be
      mentioned without circumlocution that the young lady ushered in by the
      vulgar American reporter, whom he didn&rsquo;t like and who had already come too
      often to his studio to pick up &ldquo;glimpses&rdquo; (the painter wondered how in the
      world he had picked HER up), this charming candidate for portraiture rose
      on the spot before Charles Waterlow as a precious model. She made, it may
      further be declared, quite the same impression on the gentleman who was
      with him and who never took his eyes off her while her own rested afresh
      on several finished and unfinished canvases. This gentleman asked of his
      friend at the end of five minutes the favour of an introduction to her; in
      consequence of which Francie learned that his name&mdash;she thought it
      singular&mdash;was Gaston Probert. Mr. Probert was a kind-eyed smiling
      youth who fingered the points of his moustache; he was represented by Mr.
      Waterlow as an American, but he pronounced the American language&mdash;so
      at least it seemed to Francie&mdash;as if it had been French.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had quitted the studio with Delia and Mr. Flack&mdash;her father
      on this occasion not being of the party&mdash;the two young men, falling
      back on their divan, broke into expressions of aesthetic rapture, gave it
      to each other that the girl had qualities&mdash;oh but qualities and a
      charm of line! They remained there an hour, studying these rare properties
      through the smoke of their cigarettes. You would have gathered from their
      conversation&mdash;though as regards much of it only perhaps with the aid
      of a grammar and dictionary&mdash;that the young lady had been endowed
      with plastic treasures, that is with physical graces, of the highest
      order, of which she was evidently quite unconscious. Before this, however,
      Mr. Waterlow had come to an understanding with his visitors&mdash;it had
      been settled that Miss Francina should sit for him at his first hour of
      leisure. Unfortunately that hour hovered before him as still rather
      distant&mdash;he was unable to make a definite appointment. He had sitters
      on his hands, he had at least three portraits to finish before going to
      Spain. He adverted with bitterness to the journey to Spain&mdash;a little
      excursion laid out precisely with his friend Probert for the last weeks of
      the spring, the first of the southern summer, the time of the long days
      and the real light. Gaston Probert re-echoed his regrets, for though he
      had no business with Miss Francina, whose name he yet liked, he also
      wanted to see her again. They half-agreed to give up Spain&mdash;they had
      after all been there before&mdash;so that Waterlow might take the girl in
      hand without delay, the moment he had knocked off his present work. This
      amendment broke down indeed, for other considerations came up and the
      artist resigned himself to the arrangement on which the young women had
      quitted him: he thought it so characteristic of their nationality that
      they should settle a matter of that sort for themselves. This was simply
      that they should come back in the autumn, when he should be comparatively
      free: then there would be a margin and they might all take their time. At
      present, before long&mdash;by the time he should be ready&mdash;the
      question of the pretty one&rsquo;s leaving Paris for the summer would be sure to
      rise, and that would be a tiresome interruption. The pretty one clearly
      liked Paris, she had no plans for the autumn and only wanted a reason to
      come back about the twentieth of September. Mr. Waterlow remarked
      humorously that she evidently bossed the shop. Meanwhile, before starting
      for Spain, he would see her as often as possible&mdash;his eye would take
      possession of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion envied his eye, even expressed jealousy of his eye. It was
      perhaps as a step towards establishing his right to jealousy that Mr.
      Probert left a card upon the Miss Dossons at the Hotel de l&rsquo;Univers et de
      Cheltenham, having first ascertained that such a proceeding would not, by
      the young American sisters, be regarded as an unwarrantable liberty.
      Gaston Probert was an American who had never been in America and was
      obliged to take counsel on such an emergency as that. He knew that in
      Paris young men didn&rsquo;t call at hotels on blameless maids, but he also knew
      that blameless maids, unattended by a parent, didn&rsquo;t visit young men in
      studios; and he had no guide, no light he could trust&mdash;none save the
      wisdom of his friend Waterlow, which was for the most part communicated to
      him in a derisive and misleading form. Waterlow, who was after all himself
      an ornament of the French, and the very French, school, jeered at the
      other&rsquo;s want of native instinct, at the way he never knew by which end to
      take hold of a compatriot. Poor Probert was obliged to confess to his
      terrible paucity of practice, and that in the great medley of aliens and
      brothers&mdash;and even more of sisters&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t tell which was
      which. He would have had a country and countrymen, to say nothing of
      countrywomen, if he could; but that matter had never been properly settled
      for him, and it&rsquo;s one there&rsquo;s ever a great difficulty in a gentleman&rsquo;s
      settling for himself. Born in Paris, he had been brought up altogether on
      French lines, in a family that French society had irrecoverably absorbed.
      His father, a Carolinian and a Catholic, was a Gallomaniac of the old
      American type. His three sisters had married Frenchmen, and one of them
      lived in Brittany while the others were ostensibly seated in Touraine. His
      only brother had fallen, during the Terrible Year, in defence of their
      adopted country. Yet Gaston, though he had had an old Legitimist marquis
      for godfather, was not legally one of its children; his mother had, on her
      death-bed, extorted from him the promise that he wouldn&rsquo;t take service in
      its armies; she considered, after the death of her elder son&mdash;Gaston,
      in 1870, had been a boy of ten&mdash;that the family had sacrificed enough
      on the altar of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man therefore, between two stools, had no clear sitting-place:
      he wanted to be as American as he could and yet not less French than he
      was; he was afraid to give up the little that he was and find that what he
      might be was less&mdash;he shrank from a flying leap which might drop him
      in the middle of the sea. At the same time he thought himself sure that
      the only way to know how it feels to be an American is to try it, and he
      had had many a purpose of making the pious pilgrimage. His family however
      had been so completely Gallicised that the affairs of each member of it
      were the affairs of all the rest, and his father, his sisters and his
      brothers-in-law had not yet begun sufficiently to regard this scheme as
      their own for him to feel it substantially his. It was a family in which
      there was no individual but only a collective property. Meanwhile he
      tried, as I say, by affronting minor perils, and especially by going a
      good deal to see Charles Waterlow in the Avenue de Villiers, whom he
      believed to be his dearest friend, formed for his affection by Monsieur
      Carolus. He had an idea that in this manner he kept himself in touch with
      his countrymen; and he had never pitched his endeavour so high as in
      leaving that card on the Misses Dosson. He was in search of freshness, but
      he needn&rsquo;t have gone far: he would have had but to turn his lantern on his
      own young breast to find a considerable store of it. Like many of his
      dawdling coaevals he gave much attention to art, lived as much as possible
      in that more select world where it is a positive duty not to bustle. To
      make up for his want of talent he espoused the talent of others&mdash;that
      is of several&mdash;and was as sensitive and conscientious about them as
      he might have been about himself. He defended certain of Waterlow&rsquo;s
      purples and greens as he would have defended his own honour, and there was
      a genius or two, not yet fully acclaimed by the vulgar, in regard to whom
      he had convictions that belonged almost to the undiscussable part of life.
      He had not, for himself, any very high sense of performance, but what kept
      it down particularly was his untractable hand, the fact that, such as they
      were, Waterlow&rsquo;s purples and greens, for instance, were far beyond him. If
      he hadn&rsquo;t failed there other failures wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered, not even
      that of not having a country; and it was on the occasion of his friend&rsquo;s
      agreement to paint that strange lovely girl, whom he liked so much and
      whose companions he didn&rsquo;t like, that he felt supremely without a
      vocation. Freshness was in HER at least, if he had only been organised for
      catching it. He prayed earnestly, in relation to such a triumph, for a
      providential re-enforcement of Waterlow&rsquo;s sense of that source of charm.
      If Waterlow had a fault it was that his freshnesses were sometimes too
      crude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He avenged himself for the artist&rsquo;s profanation of his first attempt to
      approach Miss Francie by indulging at the end of another week in a second.
      He went about six o&rsquo;clock, when he supposed she would have returned from
      her day&rsquo;s wanderings, and his prudence was rewarded by the sight of the
      young lady sitting in the court of the hotel with her father and sister.
      Mr. Dosson was new to Gaston Probert, but the young man might have been a
      naturalist visiting a rank country with a net of such narrow meshes as to
      let no creature of the air escape. The little party was as usual expecting
      Mr. Flack at any moment, and they had collected downstairs, so that he
      might pick them up easily. They had, on the first floor, an expensive
      parlour, decorated in white and gold, with sofas of crimson damask; but
      there was something lonely in that grandeur and the place had become
      mainly a receptacle for their tall trunks, with a half-emptied paper of
      chocolates or marrons glaces on every table. After young Probert&rsquo;s first
      call his name was often on the lips of the simple trio, and Mr. Dosson
      grew still more jocose, making nothing of a secret of his perception that
      Francie hit the bull&rsquo;s-eye &ldquo;every time.&rdquo; Mr. Waterlow had returned their
      visit, but that was rather a matter of course, since it was they who had
      gone after him. They had not gone after the other one; it was he who had
      come after them. When he entered the hotel, as they sat there, this
      pursuit and its probable motive became startlingly vivid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia had taken the matter much more seriously than her father; she said
      there was ever so much she wanted to find out. She mused upon these
      mysteries visibly, but with no great advance, and she appealed for
      assistance to George Flack, with a candour which he appreciated and
      returned. If he really knew anything he ought to know at least who Mr.
      Probert was; and she spoke as if it would be in the natural course that as
      soon as he should find out he would put it for them somehow into his
      paper. Mr. Flack promised to &ldquo;nose round&rdquo;; he said the best plan would be
      that the results should &ldquo;come back&rdquo; to her in the Reverberator; it might
      have been gathered from him that &ldquo;the people over there&rdquo;&mdash;in other
      words the mass of their compatriots&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t be unpersuadable that
      they wanted about a column on Mr. Probert. His researches were to prove
      none the less fruitless, for in spite of the vivid fact the girl was able
      to give him as a starting-point, the fact that their new acquaintance had
      spent his whole life in Paris, the young journalist couldn&rsquo;t scare up a
      single person who had even heard of him. He had questioned up and down and
      all over the place, from the Rue Scribe to the far end of Chaillot, and he
      knew people who knew others who knew every member of the American colony;
      that select settled body, which haunted poor Delia&rsquo;s imagination,
      glittered and re-echoed there in a hundred tormenting roundabout glimpses.
      That was where she wanted to &ldquo;get&rdquo; Francie, as she said to herself; she
      wanted to get her right in there. She believed the members of this society
      to constitute a little kingdom of the blest; and she used to drive through
      the Avenue Gabriel, the Rue de Marignan and the wide vistas which radiate
      from the Arch of Triumph and are always changing their names, on purpose
      to send up wistful glances to the windows&mdash;she had learned that all
      this was the happy quarter&mdash;of the enviable but unapproachable
      colonists. She saw these privileged mortals, as she supposed, in almost
      every victoria that made a languid lady with a pretty head dash past her,
      and she had no idea how little honour this theory sometimes did her
      expatriated countrywomen. Her plan was already made to be on the field
      again the next winter and take it up seriously, this question of getting
      Francie in.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Flack remarked that young Probert&rsquo;s net couldn&rsquo;t be either the
      rose or anything near it, since they had shed no petal, at any general
      shake, on the path of the oldest inhabitant, Delia had a flash of
      inspiration, an intellectual flight that she herself didn&rsquo;t measure at the
      time. She asked if that didn&rsquo;t perhaps prove on the contrary quite the
      opposite&mdash;that they were just THE cream and beyond all others. Wasn&rsquo;t
      there a kind of inner, very FAR in, circle, and wouldn&rsquo;t they be somewhere
      about the centre of that? George Flack almost quivered at this weird hit
      as from one of the blind, for he guessed on the spot that Delia Dosson
      had, as he would have said, got there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you mean one of those families that have worked down so far you
      can&rsquo;t find where they went in?&rdquo;&mdash;that was the phrase in which he
      recognised the truth of the girl&rsquo;s grope. Delia&rsquo;s fixed eyes assented, and
      after a moment of cogitation George Flack broke out: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of
      family we want to handle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps they won&rsquo;t want to be handled,&rdquo; Delia had returned with a
      still wilder and more remarkable play of inspiration. &ldquo;You had better find
      out,&rdquo; she had added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chance to find out might have seemed to present itself after Mr.
      Probert had walked in that confiding way into the hotel; for his arrival
      had been followed a quarter of an hour later by that of the representative
      of the Reverberator. Gaston had liked the way they treated him&mdash;though
      demonstrative it was not artificial. Mr. Dosson had said they had been
      hoping he would come round again, and Delia had remarked that she supposed
      he had had quite a journey&mdash;Paris was so big; and had urged his
      acceptance of a glass of wine or a cup of tea. Mentioning that that wasn&rsquo;t
      the place where they usually received&mdash;she liked to hear herself talk
      of &ldquo;receiving&rdquo;&mdash;she led the party up to her white-and-gold saloon,
      where they should be so much more private: she liked also to hear herself
      talk of privacy. They sat on the red silk chairs and she hoped Mr. Probert
      would at least taste a sugared chestnut or a chocolate; and when he
      declined, pleading the imminence of the dinner-hour, she sighed: &ldquo;Well, I
      suppose you&rsquo;re so used to them&mdash;to the best&mdash;living so long over
      here.&rdquo; The allusion to the dinner-hour led Mr. Dosson to the frank hope
      that he would go round and dine with them without ceremony; they were
      expecting a friend&mdash;he generally settled it for them&mdash;who was
      coming to take them round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then we&rsquo;re going to the circus,&rdquo; Francie said, speaking for the first
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had not spoken before she had done something still more to the
      purpose; she had removed any shade of doubt that might have lingered in
      the young man&rsquo;s spirit as to her charm of line. He was aware that the
      education of Paris, acting upon a natural aptitude, had opened him much&mdash;rendered
      him perhaps even morbidly sensitive&mdash;to impressions of this order;
      the society of artists, the talk of studios, the attentive study of
      beautiful works, the sight of a thousand forms of curious research and
      experiment, had produced in his mind a new sense, the exercise of which
      was a conscious enjoyment and the supreme gratification of which, on
      several occasions, had given him as many indelible memories. He had once
      said to his friend Waterlow: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s a confession of a
      very poor life, but the most important things that have happened to me in
      this world have been simply half a dozen visual impressions&mdash;things
      that happened through my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah malheureux, you&rsquo;re lost!&rdquo; the painter had exclaimed in answer to this,
      and without even taking the trouble to explain his ominous speech. Gaston
      Probert however had not been frightened by it, and he continued to be
      thankful for the sensitive plate that nature had lodged in his brain and
      that culture had brought to so high a polish. The experience of the eye
      was doubtless not everything, but it was so much gained, so much saved, in
      a world in which other treasures were apt to slip through one&rsquo;s fingers;
      and above all it had the merit that so many things gave it and that
      nothing could take it away. He had noted in a moment how straight Francie
      Dosson gave it; and now, seeing her a second time, he felt her promote it
      in a degree which made acquaintance with her one of those &ldquo;important&rdquo;
       facts of which he had spoken to Charles Waterlow. It was in the case of
      such an accident as this that he felt the value of his Parisian education.
      It made him revel in his modern sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was therefore not directly the prospect of the circus that induced him
      to accept Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s invitation; nor was it even the charm exerted by
      the girl&rsquo;s appearing, in the few words she uttered, to appeal to him for
      herself. It was his feeling that on the edge of the glittering ring her
      type would attach him to her, to her only, and that if he knew it was rare
      she herself didn&rsquo;t. He liked to be intensely conscious, but liked others
      not to be. It seemed to him at this moment, after he had told Mr. Dosson
      he should be delighted to spend the evening with them, that he was indeed
      trying hard to measure how it would feel to recover the national tie; he
      had jumped on the ship, he was pitching away to the west. He had led his
      sister, Mme. de Brecourt, to expect that he would dine with her&mdash;she
      was having a little party; so that if she could see the people to whom,
      without a scruple, with a quick sense of refreshment and freedom, he now
      sacrificed her! He knew who was coming to his sister&rsquo;s in the Place
      Beauvau: Mme. d&rsquo;Outreville and M. de Grospre, old M. Courageau, Mme. de
      Drives, Lord and Lady Trantum, Mile de Saintonge; but he was fascinated by
      the idea of the contrast between what he preferred and what he gave up.
      His life had long been wanting&mdash;painfully wanting&mdash;in the
      element of contrast, and here was a chance to bring it in. He saw it come
      in powerfully with Mr. Flack, after Miss Dosson had proposed they should
      walk off without their initiator. Her father didn&rsquo;t favour this
      suggestion; he said &ldquo;We want a double good dinner to-day and Mr. Flack has
      got to order it.&rdquo; Upon this Delia had asked the visitor if HE couldn&rsquo;t
      order&mdash;a Frenchman like him; and Francie had interrupted, before he
      could answer the question, &ldquo;Well, ARE you a Frenchman? That&rsquo;s just the
      point, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Gaston Probert replied that he had no wish but to be a
      citizen of HER country, and the elder sister asked him if he knew many
      Americans in Paris. He was obliged to confess he knew almost none, but
      hastened to add he was eager to go on now he had taken such a charming
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh we ain&rsquo;t anything&mdash;if you mean that,&rdquo; Delia said. &ldquo;If you go on
      you&rsquo;ll go on beyond us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t anything here, my dear, but we&rsquo;re a good deal at home,&rdquo; Mr.
      Dosson jocosely interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re very nice anywhere!&rdquo; Francie exclaimed; upon which Gaston
      Probert declared that they were as delightful as possible. It was in these
      amenities that George Flack found them engaged; but there was none the
      less a certain eagerness in his greeting of the other guest, as if he had
      it in mind to ask him how soon he could give him half an hour. I hasten to
      add that with the turn the occasion presently took the correspondent of
      the Reverberator dropped the conception of making the young man &ldquo;talk&rdquo; for
      the benefit of the subscribers to that journal. They all went out
      together, and the impulse to pick up something, usually so irresistible in
      George Flack&rsquo;s mind, suffered an odd check. He found himself wanting to
      handle his fellow visitor in a sense other than the professional. Mr.
      Probert talked very little to Francie, but though Mr. Flack didn&rsquo;t know
      that on a first occasion he would have thought this aggressive, even
      rather brutal, he knew it was for Francie, and Francie alone, that the
      fifth member of the party was there. He said to himself suddenly and in
      perfect sincerity that it was a mean class anyway, the people for whom
      their own country wasn&rsquo;t good enough. He didn&rsquo;t go so far, however, when
      they were seated at the admirable establishment of M. Durand in the Place
      de la Madeleine, as to order a bad dinner to spite his competitor; nor did
      he, to spoil this gentleman&rsquo;s amusement, take uncomfortable seats at the
      pretty circus in the Champs Elysees to which, at half-past eight o&rsquo;clock,
      the company was conveyed&mdash;it was a drive of but five minutes&mdash;in
      a couple of cabs. The occasion therefore was superficially smooth, and he
      could see that the sense of being disagreeable to an American
      newspaper-man was not needed to make his nondescript rival enjoy it. That
      gentleman did indeed hate his crude accent and vulgar laugh and above all
      the lamblike submission to him of their friends. Mr. Flack was acute
      enough for an important observation: he cherished it and promised himself
      to bring it to the notice of his clinging charges. Their imperturbable
      guest professed a great desire to be of service to the young ladies&mdash;to
      do what would help them to be happy in Paris; but he gave no hint of the
      intention that would contribute most to such a result, the bringing them
      in contact with the other members, especially with the female members, of
      his family. George Flack knew nothing about the matter, but he required
      for purposes of argument that Mr. Probert&rsquo;s family should have female
      members, and it was lucky for him that his assumption was just. He grasped
      in advance the effect with which he should impress it on Francie and Delia&mdash;but
      notably on Delia, who would then herself impress it on Francie&mdash;that
      it would be time for their French friend to talk when he had brought his
      mother round. BUT HE NEVER WOULD&mdash;they might bet their pile on that!
      He never did, in the strange sequel&mdash;having, poor young man, no
      mother to bring. Moreover he was quite mum&mdash;as Delia phrased it to
      herself&mdash;about Mme. de Brecourt and Mme. de Cliche: such, Miss Dosson
      learned from Charles Waterlow, were the names of his two sisters who had
      houses in Paris&mdash;gleaning at the same time the information that one
      of these ladies was a marquise and the other a comtesse. She was less
      exasperated by their non-appearance than Mr. Flack had hoped, and it
      didn&rsquo;t prevent an excursion to dine at Saint-Germain a week after the
      evening spent at the circus, which included both the new admirers. It also
      as a matter of course included Mr. Flack, for though the party had been
      proposed in the first instance by Charles Waterlow, who wished to multiply
      opportunities for studying his future sitter, Mr. Dosson had
      characteristically constituted himself host and administrator, with the
      young journalist as his deputy. He liked to invite people and to pay for
      them, and disliked to be invited and paid for. He was never inwardly
      content on any occasion unless a great deal of money was spent, and he
      could be sure enough of the large amount only when he himself spent it. He
      was too simple for conceit or for pride of purse, but always felt any
      arrangements shabby and sneaking as to which the expense hadn&rsquo;t been
      referred to him. He never named what he paid for anything. Also Delia had
      made him understand that if they should go to Saint-Germain as guests of
      the artist and his friend Mr. Flack wouldn&rsquo;t be of the company: she was
      sure those gentlemen wouldn&rsquo;t rope HIM in. In fact she was too sure, for,
      though enjoying him not at all, Charles Waterlow would on this occasion
      have made a point of expressing by an act of courtesy his sense of
      obligation to a man who had brought him such a subject. Delia&rsquo;s hint
      however was all-sufficient for her father; he would have thought it a
      gross breach of friendly loyalty to take part in a festival not graced by
      Mr. Flack&rsquo;s presence. His idea of loyalty was that he should scarcely
      smoke a cigar unless his friend was there to take another, and he felt
      rather mean if he went round alone to get shaved. As regards Saint-Germain
      he took over the project while George Flack telegraphed for a table on the
      terrace at the Pavilion Henri Quatre. Mr. Dosson had by this time learned
      to trust the European manager of the Reverberator to spend his money
      almost as he himself would.

      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Delia had broken out the evening they took Mr. Probert to the circus; she
      had apostrophised Francie as they each sat in a red-damask chair after
      ascending to their apartments. They had bade their companions farewell at
      the door of the hotel and the two gentlemen had walked off in different
      directions. But upstairs they had instinctively not separated; they
      dropped into the first places and sat looking at each other and at the
      highly-decorated lamps that burned night after night in their empty
      saloon. &ldquo;Well, I want to know when you&rsquo;re going to stop,&rdquo; Delia said to
      her sister, speaking as if this remark were a continuation, which it was
      not, of something they had lately been saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop what?&rdquo; asked Francie, reaching forward for a marron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop carrying-on the way you do&mdash;with Mr. Flack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie stared while she consumed her marron; then she replied in her
      small flat patient voice: &ldquo;Why, Delia Dosson, how can you be so foolish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I wish you&rsquo;d speak to her. Francie, I ain&rsquo;t foolish,&rdquo; Delia
      submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to say to her?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson enquired. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve
      said about all I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s in fun. I want you to speak to her in earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s no one in earnest but you,&rdquo; Francie remarked. &ldquo;These
      ain&rsquo;t so good as the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO, and there won&rsquo;t be if you don&rsquo;t look out. There&rsquo;s something you can
      do if you&rsquo;ll just keep quiet. If you can&rsquo;t tell difference of style, well,
      I can!&rdquo; Delia cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference of style?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dosson. But before this
      question could be answered Francie protested against the charge of
      &ldquo;carrying-on.&rdquo; Quiet? Wasn&rsquo;t she as quiet as a Quaker meeting? Delia
      replied that a girl wasn&rsquo;t quiet so long as she didn&rsquo;t keep others so; and
      she wanted to know what her sister proposed to do about Mr. Flack. &ldquo;Why
      don&rsquo;t you take him and let Francie take the other?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m after&mdash;to make her take the other,&rdquo; said his
      elder daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him&mdash;how do you mean?&rdquo; Francie returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess you know how!&rdquo; Mr. Dosson laughed with an absence of
      prejudice that might have been deplored in a parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to stay in Europe or not? that&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> want to know,&rdquo;
       Delia pursued to her sister. &ldquo;If you want to go bang home you&rsquo;re taking
      the right way to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has that got to do with it?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson audibly wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you like so much to reside at that place&mdash;where is it?&mdash;where
      his paper&rsquo;s published? That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll have to pull up sooner or
      later,&rdquo; Delia declaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to stay right here in Europe, father?&rdquo; Francie said with her
      small sweet weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on what you mean by staying right here. I want to go right
      home SOME time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then you&rsquo;ve got to go without Mr. Probert,&rdquo; Delia made answer with
      decision. &ldquo;If you think he wants to live over there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Delia, he wants dreadfully to go&mdash;he told me so himself,&rdquo;
       Francie argued with passionless pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and when he gets there he&rsquo;ll want to come back. I thought you were
      so much interested in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child, I AM interested!&rdquo; smiled Francie. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I interested,
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know how you could act differently to show it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do then,&rdquo; said Delia. &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t make Mr. Flack understand
      <i>I</i> will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I guess he understands&mdash;he&rsquo;s so bright,&rdquo; Francie vaguely pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess he does&mdash;he IS bright,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson. &ldquo;Good-night,
      chickens,&rdquo; he added; and wandered off to a couch of untroubled repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughters sat up half an hour later, but not by the wish of the
      younger girl. She was always passive, however, always docile when Delia
      was, as she said, on the war-path, and though she had none of her sister&rsquo;s
      insistence she was courageous in suffering. She thought Delia whipped her
      up too much, but there was that in her which would have prevented her ever
      running away. She could smile and smile for an hour without irritation,
      making even pacific answers, though all the while it hurt her to be
      heavily exhorted, much as it would have done to be violently pushed. She
      knew Delia loved her&mdash;not loving herself meanwhile a bit&mdash;as no
      one else in the world probably ever would; but there was something funny
      in such plans for her&mdash;plans of ambition which could only involve a
      &ldquo;fuss.&rdquo; The real answer to anything, to everything her sister might say at
      these hours of urgency was: &ldquo;Oh if you want to make out that people are
      thinking of me or that they ever will, you ought to remember that no one
      can possibly think of me half as much as you do. Therefore if there&rsquo;s to
      be any comfort for either of us we had both much better just go on as we
      are.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t however on this occasion meet her constant companion with
      that syllogism, because a formidable force seemed to lurk in the great
      contention that the star of matrimony for the American girl was now
      shining in the east&mdash;in England and France and Italy. They had only
      to look round anywhere to see it: what did they hear of every day in the
      week but of the engagement of somebody no better than they to some count
      or some lord? Delia dwelt on the evident truth that it was in that vast
      vague section of the globe to which she never alluded save as &ldquo;over here&rdquo;
       that the American girl was now called upon to play, under providence, her
      part. When Francie made the point that Mr. Probert was neither a count nor
      a lord her sister rejoined that she didn&rsquo;t care whether he was or not. To
      this Francie replied that she herself didn&rsquo;t care, but that Delia ought to
      for consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a prince compared with Mr. Flack,&rdquo; Delia declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t the same ability; not half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has the ability to have three sisters who are just the sort of people
      I want you to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will they do me?&rdquo; Francie asked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hate me. Before they
      could turn round I should do something&mdash;in perfect innocence&mdash;that
      they&rsquo;d think monstrous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what would that matter if HE liked you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh but he wouldn&rsquo;t then! He&rsquo;d hate me too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then all you&rsquo;ve got to do is not to do it,&rdquo; Delia concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh but I should&mdash;every time,&rdquo; her sister went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia looked at her a moment. &ldquo;What ARE you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what am I? It&rsquo;s disgusting!&rdquo; And Francie sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you have such thoughts,&rdquo; said Delia sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting to talk about a gentleman&mdash;and his sisters and his
      society and everything else&mdash;before he has scarcely looked at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting if he isn&rsquo;t just dying; but it isn&rsquo;t if he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll make him skip!&rdquo; Francie went on with a sudden approach to
      sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re worse than father!&rdquo; her sister cried, giving her a push as they
      went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached Saint-Germain with their companions nearly an hour before the
      time it had been agreed they had best dine; the purpose of this being to
      enable them to enjoy with what remained of daylight a stroll on the
      celebrated terrace and a study of the magnificent view. The evening was
      splendid and the atmosphere favourable to these impressions; the grass was
      vivid on the broad walk beside the parapet, the park and forest were fresh
      and leafy and the prettiest golden light hung over the curving Seine and
      the far-spreading city. The hill which forms the terrace stretched down
      among the vineyards, with the poles delicate yet in their bareness, to the
      river, and the prospect was spotted here and there with the red legs of
      the little sauntering soldiers of the garrison. How it came, after Delia&rsquo;s
      warning in regard to her carrying-on&mdash;especially as she hadn&rsquo;t failed
      to feel the weight of her sister&rsquo;s wisdom&mdash;Francie couldn&rsquo;t have told
      herself: certain it is that before ten minutes had elapsed she became
      aware, first, that the evening wouldn&rsquo;t pass without Mr. Flack&rsquo;s taking in
      some way, and for a certain time, peculiar possession of her; and then
      that he was already doing so, that he had drawn her away from the others,
      who were stopping behind to appreciate the view, that he made her walk
      faster, and that he had ended by interposing such a distance that she was
      practically alone with him. This was what he wanted, but it was not all;
      she saw he now wanted a great many other things. The large perspective of
      the terrace stretched away before them&mdash;Mr. Probert had said it was
      in the grand style&mdash;and he was determined to make her walk to the
      end. She felt sorry for his ideas&mdash;she thought of them in the light
      of his striking energy; they were an idle exercise of a force
      intrinsically fine, and she wanted to protest, to let him know how truly
      it was a sad misuse of his free bold spirit to count on her. She was not
      to be counted on; she was a vague soft negative being who had never
      decided anything and never would, who had not even the merit of knowing
      how to flirt and who only asked to be let alone. She made him stop at
      last, telling him, while she leaned against the parapet, that he walked
      too fast; and she looked back at their companions, whom she expected to
      see, under pressure from Delia, following at the highest speed. But they
      were not following; they still stood together there, only looking,
      attentively enough, at the couple who had left them. Delia would wave a
      parasol, beckon her back, send Mr. Waterlow to bring her; Francie invoked
      from one moment to another some such appeal as that. But no appeal came;
      none at least but the odd spectacle, presently, of an agitation of the
      group, which, evidently under Delia&rsquo;s direction, turned round and retraced
      its steps. Francie guessed in a moment what was meant by that; it was the
      most definite signal her sister could have given. It made her feel that
      Delia counted on her, but to such a different end, just as poor Mr. Flack
      did, just as Delia wished to persuade her that Mr. Probert did. The girl
      gave a sigh, looking up with troubled eyes at her companion and at the
      figure of herself as the subject of contending policies. Such a thankless
      bored evasive little subject as she felt herself! What Delia had said in
      turning away was&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m watching you, and I depend on you to
      finish him up. Stay there with him, go off with him&mdash;I&rsquo;ll allow you
      half an hour if necessary: only settle him once for all. It&rsquo;s very kind of
      me to give you this chance, and in return for it I expect you to be able
      to tell me this evening that he has his answer. Shut him up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie didn&rsquo;t in the least dislike Mr. Flack. Interested as I am in
      presenting her favourably to the reader I am yet obliged as a veracious
      historian to admit that she believed him as &ldquo;bright&rdquo; as her father had
      originally pronounced him and as any young man she was likely to meet. She
      had no other measure for distinction in young men but their brightness;
      she had never been present at any imputation of ability or power that this
      term didn&rsquo;t seem to cover. In many a girl so great a kindness might have
      been fanned to something of a flame by the breath of close criticism. I
      probably exaggerate little the perversity of pretty girls in saying that
      our young woman might at this moment have answered her sister with: &ldquo;No, I
      wasn&rsquo;t in love with him, but somehow, since you&rsquo;re so very disgusted, I
      foresee that I shall be if he presses me.&rdquo; It is doubtless difficult to
      say more for Francie&rsquo;s simplicity of character than that she felt no need
      of encouraging Mr. Flack in order to prove to herself that she wasn&rsquo;t
      bullied. She didn&rsquo;t care whether she were bullied or not, and she was
      perfectly capable of letting Delia believe her to have carried mildness to
      the point of giving up a man she had a secret sentiment for in order to
      oblige a relative who fairly brooded with devotion. She wasn&rsquo;t clear
      herself as to whether it mightn&rsquo;t be so; her pride, what she had of it,
      lay in an undistributed inert form quite at the bottom of her heart, and
      she had never yet thought of a dignified theory to cover her want of
      uppishness. She felt as she looked up at Mr. Flack that she didn&rsquo;t care
      even if he should think she sacrificed him to a childish docility. His
      bright eyes were hard, as if he could almost guess how cynical she was,
      and she turned her own again toward her retreating companions. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      going to dinner; we oughtn&rsquo;t to be dawdling here,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if they&rsquo;re going to dinner they&rsquo;ll have to eat the napkins. I
      ordered it and I know when it&rsquo;ll be ready,&rdquo; George Flack answered.
      &ldquo;Besides, they&rsquo;re not going to dinner, they&rsquo;re going to walk in the park.
      Don&rsquo;t you worry, we shan&rsquo;t lose them. I wish we could!&rdquo; the young man
      added in his boldest gayest manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish we could?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to feel you just under my particular protection and no
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know what the dangers are,&rdquo; said Francie, setting herself
      in motion again. She went after the others, but at the end of a few steps
      he stopped her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have confidence. I wish you&rsquo;d believe what I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me anything.&rdquo; And she turned her back to him, looking
      away at the splendid view. &ldquo;I do love the scenery,&rdquo; she added in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, leave it alone a little&mdash;it won&rsquo;t run away! I want to tell you
      something about myself, if I could flatter myself you&rsquo;d take any interest
      in it.&rdquo; He had thrust the raised point of his cane into the low wall of
      the terrace, and he leaned on the knob, screwing the other end gently
      round with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take an interest if I can understand,&rdquo; said Francie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can understand right enough if you&rsquo;ll try. I got to-day some news
      from America,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that I like awfully. The Reverberator has
      taken a jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not what Francie had expected, but it was better. &ldquo;Taken a jump?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has gone straight up. It&rsquo;s in the second hundred thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundred thousand dollars?&rdquo; said Francie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Francie, copies. That&rsquo;s the circulation. But the dollars are
      footing up too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do they all come to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precious few of them! I wish they did. It&rsquo;s a sweet property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t yours?&rdquo; she asked, turning round to him. It was an impulse
      of sympathy that made her look at him now, for she already knew how much
      he had the success of his newspaper at heart. He had once told her he
      loved the Reverberator as he had loved his first jack-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine? You don&rsquo;t mean to say you suppose I own it!&rdquo; George Flack shouted.
      The light projected upon her innocence by his tone was so strong that the
      girl blushed, and he went on more tenderly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty sight, the way
      you and your sister take that sort of thing for granted. Do you think
      property grows on you like a moustache? Well, it seems as if it had, on
      your father. If I owned the Reverberator I wouldn&rsquo;t be stumping round
      here; I&rsquo;d give my attention to another branch of the business. That is I&rsquo;d
      give my attention to all, but I wouldn&rsquo;t go round with the delivery-cart.
      Still, I&rsquo;m going to capture the blamed thing, and I want you to help me,&rdquo;
       the young man went on; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just what I wanted to speak to you about.
      It&rsquo;s a big proposition as it stands, but I mean to make it bigger: the
      most universal society-paper the world has seen. That&rsquo;s where the future
      lies, and the man who sees it first is the man who&rsquo;ll make his pile. It&rsquo;s
      a field for enlightened enterprise that hasn&rsquo;t yet begun to be worked.&rdquo; He
      continued, glowing as if on a sudden with his idea, and one of his knowing
      eyes half-closed itself for an emphasis habitual with him when he talked
      consecutively. The effect of this would have been droll to a listener, the
      note of the prospectus mingling with the question of his more intimate
      hope. But it was not droll to Francie; she only thought it, or supposed
      it, a proof of the way Mr. Flack saw everything on a stupendous scale.
      &ldquo;There are ten thousand things to do that haven&rsquo;t been done, and I&rsquo;m going
      to do them. The society-news of every quarter of the globe, furnished by
      the prominent members themselves&mdash;oh THEY can be fixed, you&rsquo;ll see!&mdash;from
      day to day and from hour to hour and served up hot at every
      breakfast-table in the United States: that&rsquo;s what the American people want
      and that&rsquo;s what the American people are going to have. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it
      to every one, but I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, that I consider my guess as
      good as the next man&rsquo;s on what&rsquo;s going to be required in future over
      there. I&rsquo;m going for the inside view, the choice bits, the chronique
      intime, as they say here; what the people want&rsquo;s just what ain&rsquo;t told, and
      I&rsquo;m going to tell it. Oh they&rsquo;re bound to have the plums! That&rsquo;s about
      played out, anyway, the idea of sticking up a sign of &lsquo;private&rsquo; and &lsquo;hands
      off&rsquo; and &lsquo;no thoroughfare&rsquo; and thinking you can keep the place to
      yourself. You ain&rsquo;t going to be able any longer to monopolise any fact of
      general interest, and it ain&rsquo;t going to be right you should; it ain&rsquo;t
      going to continue to be possible to keep out anywhere the light of the
      Press. Now what I&rsquo;m going to do is to set up the biggest lamp yet made and
      make it shine all over the place. We&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s private then, and whose
      hands are off, and who&rsquo;ll frustrate the People&mdash;the People THAT WANTS
      TO KNOW. That&rsquo;s a sign of the American people that they DO want to know,
      and it&rsquo;s the sign of George P. Flack,&rdquo; the young man pursued with a rising
      spirit, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s going to help them. But I&rsquo;ll make the touchy folks
      crowd in THEMSELVES with their information, and as I tell you, Miss
      Francie, it&rsquo;s a job in which you can give me a lovely lift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see how,&rdquo; said Francie candidly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any choice
      bits or any facts of general interest.&rdquo; She spoke gaily because she was
      relieved; she thought she had in truth a glimpse of what he wanted of her.
      It was something better than she had feared. Since he didn&rsquo;t own the great
      newspaper&mdash;her view of such possibilities was of the dimmest&mdash;he
      desired to possess himself of it, and she sufficiently grasped the idea
      that money was needed for that. She further seemed to make out that he
      presented himself to her, that he hovered about her and pressed on her, as
      moneyless, and that this brought them round by a vague but comfortable
      transition to a helpful remembrance that her father was not. The remaining
      divination, silently achieved, was quick and happy: she should acquit
      herself by asking her father for the sum required and by just passing it
      on to Mr. Flack. The grandeur of his enterprise and the force of his
      reasoning appeared to overshadow her as they stood there. This was a
      delightful simplification and it didn&rsquo;t for the moment strike her as
      positively unnatural that her companion should have a delicacy about
      appealing to Mr. Dosson directly for financial aid, though indeed she
      would have been capable of thinking that odd had she meditated on it.
      There was nothing simpler to Francie than the idea of putting her hand
      into her father&rsquo;s pocket, and she felt that even Delia would be glad to
      appease their persecutor by this casual gesture. I must add unfortunately
      that her alarm came back to her from his look as he replied: &ldquo;Do you mean
      to say you don&rsquo;t know, after all I&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I tried&mdash;all I know&mdash;to make you like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, I do like you!&rdquo; cried Francie; &ldquo;but how will that help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will help me if you&rsquo;ll understand how I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; replied the girl as she walked off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her; they went on together in silence and then he said: &ldquo;Do
      you mean to say you haven&rsquo;t found that out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t find things out&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t an editor!&rdquo; Francie gaily
      quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You draw me out and then you gibe at me,&rdquo; Mr. Flack returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t draw you out. Why, couldn&rsquo;t you see me just strain to get away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you sympathise then with my ideas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do, Mr. Flack; I think your ideas splendid,&rdquo; said Francie,
      who hadn&rsquo;t in the least taken them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then why won&rsquo;t you work with me? Your affection, your brightness,
      your faith&mdash;to say nothing of your matchless beauty&mdash;would be
      everything to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, but I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could if you would, quick enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; And as soon as these words were spoken, as if to
      mitigate something of their asperity, she made her other point. &ldquo;You must
      remember that I never said I would&mdash;nor anything like it; not one
      little wee mite. I thought you just wanted me to speak to poppa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I supposed you&rsquo;d do that,&rdquo; he allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean about your paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About my paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So as he could give you the money&mdash;to do what you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, you&rsquo;re too sweet!&rdquo; George Flack cried with an illumined stare. &ldquo;Do
      you suppose I&rsquo;d ever touch a cent of your father&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;&mdash;a speech
      not rankly hypocritical, inasmuch as the young man, who made his own
      discriminations, had never been guilty, and proposed to himself never to
      be, of the indelicacy of tugging at his potential father-in-law&rsquo;s
      purse-strings with his own hand. He had talked to Mr. Dosson by the hour
      about his master-plan of making the touchy folks themselves fall into
      line, but had never dreamed this man would subsidise him as an interesting
      struggler. The only character in which he could expect it would be that of
      Francie&rsquo;s accepted suitor, and then the liberality would have Francie and
      not himself for its object. This reasoning naturally didn&rsquo;t lessen his
      impatience to take on the happy character, so that his love of his
      profession and his appreciation of the girl at his side now ached together
      in his breast with the same disappointment. She saw that her words had
      touched him like a lash; they made him for a moment flush to his eyes.
      This caused her own colour to rise&mdash;she could scarcely have said why&mdash;and
      she hurried along again. He kept close to her; he argued with her; he
      besought her to think it over, assuring her he had brains, heart and
      material proofs of a college education. To this she replied that if he
      didn&rsquo;t leave her alone she should cry&mdash;and how would he like that, to
      bring her back in such a state to the others? He answered &ldquo;Damn the
      others!&rdquo; but it didn&rsquo;t help his case, and at last he broke out: &ldquo;Will you
      just tell me this, then&mdash;is it because you&rsquo;ve promised Miss Delia?&rdquo;
       Francie returned that she hadn&rsquo;t promised Miss Delia anything, and her
      companion went on: &ldquo;Of course I know what she has got in her head: she
      wants to get you into the smart set&mdash;the grand monde, as they call it
      here; but I didn&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d let her fix your life for you. You were
      very different before HE turned up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never fixed anything for me. I haven&rsquo;t got any life and I don&rsquo;t want
      to have any,&rdquo; Francie veraciously pleaded. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re
      talking about either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man without a country. HE&rsquo;LL pass you in&mdash;that&rsquo;s what your
      sister wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to abuse him, because it was you that presented him,&rdquo; the
      girl pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never presented him! I&rsquo;d like to kick him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should never have seen him if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you,&rdquo; she maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact, but it doesn&rsquo;t make me love him any better. He&rsquo;s the
      poorest kind there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care anything about his kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity if you&rsquo;re going to marry him right off! How could I know
      that when I took you up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Flack,&rdquo; said Francie, trying to gain ground from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This attempt was of course vain, and after a moment he resumed: &ldquo;Will you
      keep me as a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Mr. Flack, OF COURSE I will!&rdquo; cried the easy creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he replied; and they presently overtook their companions.

    <p>
      Gaston Probert made his plan, confiding it only to his friend Waterlow
      whose help indeed he needed to carry it out. These revelations cost him
      something, for the ornament of the merciless school, as it might have been
      called, found his predicament amusing and made no scruple of showing it.
      Gaston was too much in love, however, to be upset by a bad joke or two.
      This fact is the more noteworthy as he knew that Waterlow scoffed at him
      for a purpose&mdash;had a view of the good to be done him by throwing him
      on the defensive. The French tradition, or a grimacing ghost of it, was in
      Waterlow&rsquo;s &ldquo;manner,&rdquo; but it had not made its mark on his view of the
      relations of a young man of spirit with parents and pastors. He mixed his
      colours, as might have been said, with the general sense of France, but
      his early American immunities and serenities could still swell his sail in
      any &ldquo;vital&rdquo; discussion with a friend in whose life the principle of
      authority played so large a part. He accused Probert of being afraid of
      his sisters, which was an effective way&mdash;and he knew it&mdash;of
      alluding to the rigidity of the conception of the family among people who
      had adopted and had even to Waterlow&rsquo;s sense, as the phrase is, improved
      upon the &ldquo;Latin" ideal. That did injustice&mdash;and this the artist also
      knew&mdash;to the delicate nature of the bond uniting the different
      members of the house of Probert, who were each for all and all for each.
      Family feeling among them was not a tyranny but a religion, and in regard
      to Mesdames de Brecourt, de Cliche and de Douves what Gaston most feared
      was that he might seem to them not to love them enough. None the less
      Charles Waterlow, who thought he had charming parts, held that the best
      way hadn&rsquo;t been taken to make a man of him, and the zeal with which the
      painter appeared to have proposed to repair that mistake was founded in
      esteem, though it sometimes flowered in freedom. Waterlow combined in odd
      fashion many of the forms of the Parisian studio with the moral and social
      ideas of Brooklyn Long Island, where the seeds of his strictness had been
      sown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaston Probert desired nothing better than to be a man; what worried him&mdash;and
      it is perhaps a proof that his instinct was gravely at fault&mdash;was a
      certain vagueness as to the constituents of that character. He should
      approximate more nearly, as it seemed to him, to the brute were he to
      sacrifice in such an effort the decencies and pieties&mdash;holy things
      all of them&mdash;in which he had been reared. It was very well for
      Waterlow to say that to be a &ldquo;real&rdquo; man it was necessary to be a little of
      a brute; his friend was willing, in theory, to assent even to that. The
      difficulty was in application, in practice&mdash;as to which the painter
      declared that all would be easy if such account hadn&rsquo;t to be taken of the
      marquise, the comtesse and&mdash;what was the other one?&mdash;the
      princess. These young amenities were exchanged between the pair&mdash;while
      Gaston explained, almost as eagerly as if he were scoring a point, that
      the other one was only a baronne&mdash;during that brief journey to Spain
      of which mention has already been made, during the later weeks of the
      summer, after their return (the friends then spent a fortnight together on
      the coast of Brittany), and above all during the autumn, when they were
      settled in Paris for the winter, when Mr. Dosson had reappeared, according
      to the engagement with his daughters, when the sittings for the portrait
      had multiplied (the painter was unscrupulous as to the number he
      demanded), and the work itself, born under a happy star, seemed to take
      more and more the turn of a great thing. It was at Granada that Gaston had
      really broken out; there, one balmy night, he had dropped into his
      comrade&rsquo;s ear that he would marry Francina Dosson or would never marry at
      all. The declaration was the more striking as it had come after such an
      interval; many days had elapsed since their separation from the young lady
      and many new and beautiful objects appealed to them. It appeared that the
      smitten youth had been thinking of her all the while, and he let his
      friend know that it was the dinner at Saint-Germain that had finished him.
      What she had been there Waterlow himself had seen: he wouldn&rsquo;t controvert
      the lucid proposition that she showed a &ldquo;cutting&rdquo; equal to any Greek gem.
    </p>
    <p>
      In November, in Paris&mdash;it was months and weeks before the artist
      began to please himself&mdash;Gaston came often to the Avenue de Villiers
      toward the end of a sitting and, till it was finished, not to disturb the
      lovely model, cultivated conversation with the elder sister: the
      representative of the Proberts was capable of that. Delia was always there
      of course, but Mr. Dosson had not once turned up and the newspaper-man
      happily appeared to have faded from view. The new aspirant learned in fact
      from Miss Dosson that a crisis in the history of his journal had recalled
      Mr. Flack to the seat of that publication. When the young ladies had gone&mdash;and
      when he didn&rsquo;t go with them; he accompanied them not rarely&mdash;the
      visitor was almost lyrical in his appreciation of his friend&rsquo;s work; he
      had no jealousy of the act of appropriation that rendered possible in its
      turn such an act of handing over, of which the canvas constituted the
      field. He was sure Waterlow painted the girl too well to be in love with
      her and that if he himself could have dealt with her in that fashion he
      mightn&rsquo;t have wanted to deal in any other. She bloomed there on the easel
      with all the purity of life, and the artist had caught the very secret of
      her beauty. It was exactly the way in which her lover would have chosen to
      see her shown, and yet it had required a perfectly independent hand.
      Gaston mused on this mystery and somehow felt proud of the picture and
      responsible for it, though it was no more his property as yet than the
      young lady herself. When in December he put before Waterlow his plan of
      campaign the latter made a comment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything in the world you
      like&mdash;anything you think will help you&mdash;but it passes me, my
      dear fellow, why in the world you don&rsquo;t go to them and say: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a
      girl who is as good as cake and pretty as fire, she exactly suits me, I&rsquo;ve
      taken time to think of it and I know what I want; therefore I propose to
      make her my wife. If you happen to like her so much the better; if you
      don&rsquo;t be so good as to keep it to yourselves.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s much the most
      excellent way. Why in the name of goodness all these mysteries and
      machinations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you don&rsquo;t understand, you don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; sighed Gaston, who had
      never pulled so long a face. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t break with one&rsquo;s traditions in an
      hour, especially when there&rsquo;s so much in them that one likes. I shan&rsquo;t
      love her more if they like her, but I shall love THEM more, and I care
      about that. You talk as a man who has nothing to consider. I&rsquo;ve everything
      to consider&mdash;and I&rsquo;m glad I have. My pleasure in marrying her will be
      double if my father and my sisters accept her, and I shall greatly enjoy
      working out the business of bringing them round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were moments when Charles Waterlow resented the very vocabulary of
      his friend; he hated to hear a man talk about the &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; by any one
      but himself of the woman he loved. One&rsquo;s own acceptance&mdash;of one&rsquo;s
      bliss&mdash;in such a case ended the matter, and the effort to bring round
      those who gave her the cold shoulder was scarcely consistent with the
      highest spirit. Young Probert explained that of course he felt his
      relatives would only have to know Francina to like her, to delight in her,
      yet also that to know her they would first have to make her acquaintance.
      This was the delicate point, for social commerce with such malheureux as
      Mr. Dosson and Delia was not in the least in their usual line and it was
      impossible to disconnect the poor girl from her appendages. Therefore the
      whole question must be approached by an oblique movement&mdash;it would
      never do to march straight up. The wedge should have a narrow end, which
      Gaston now made sure he had found. His sister Susan was another name for
      this subtle engine; he would break her in first and she would help him to
      break in the others. She was his favourite relation, his intimate friend&mdash;the
      most modern, the most Parisian and inflammable member of the family. She
      had no suite dans les idees, but she had perceptions, had imagination and
      humour, and was capable of generosity, of enthusiasm and even of blind
      infatuation. She had in fact taken two or three plunges of her own and
      ought to allow for those of others. She wouldn&rsquo;t like the Dossons
      superficially any better than his father or than Margaret or than Jane&mdash;he
      called these ladies by their English names, but for themselves, their
      husbands, their friends and each other they were Suzanne, Marguerite and
      Jeanne; but there was a good chance of his gaining her to his side. She
      was as fond of beauty and of the arts as he&mdash;this was one of their
      bonds of union. She appreciated highly Charles Waterlow&rsquo;s talent and there
      had been talk of her deciding to sit to him. It was true her husband
      viewed the project with so much colder an eye that it had not been carried
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Gaston&rsquo;s plan she was to come to the Avenue de Villiers to
      see what the artist had done for Miss Francie; her brother was to have
      worked upon her in advance by his careful rhapsodies, bearing wholly on
      the achievement itself, the dazzling example of Waterlow&rsquo;s powers, and not
      on the young lady, whom he was not to let her know at first that he had so
      much as seen. Just at the last, just before her visit, he was to mention
      to her that he had met the girl&mdash;at the studio&mdash;and that she was
      as remarkable in her way as the picture. Seeing the picture and hearing
      this, Mme. de Brecourt, as a disinterested lover of charming impressions,
      and above all as an easy prey at all times to a rabid curiosity, would
      express a desire also to enjoy a sight of so rare a creature; on which
      Waterlow might pronounce it all arrangeable if she would but come in some
      day when Miss Francie should sit. He would give her two or three dates and
      Gaston would see that she didn&rsquo;t let the opportunity pass. She would
      return alone&mdash;this time he wouldn&rsquo;t go with her&mdash;and she would
      be as taken as could be hoped or needed. Everything much depended on that,
      but it couldn&rsquo;t fail. The girl would have to take her, but the girl could
      be trusted, especially if she didn&rsquo;t know who the demonstrative French
      lady was, with her fine plain face, her hair so blond as to be nearly
      white, her vividly red lips and protuberant light-coloured eyes. Their
      host was to do no introducing and to reveal the visitor&rsquo;s identity only
      after she had gone. That was a condition indeed this participant grumbled
      at; he called the whole business an odious comedy, though his friend knew
      that if he undertook it he would acquit himself honourably. After Mme. de
      Brecourt had been captivated&mdash;the question of how Francie would be
      affected received in advance no consideration&mdash;her brother would
      throw off the mask and convince her that she must now work with him.
      Another meeting would be managed for her with the girl&mdash;in which each
      would appear in her proper character; and in short the plot would thicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaston&rsquo;s forecast of his difficulties showed how finely he could analyse;
      but that was not rare enough in any French connexion to make his friend
      stare. He brought Suzanne de Brecourt, she was enchanted with the portrait
      of the little American, and the rest of the drama began to follow in its
      order. Mme. de Brecourt raved to Waterlow&rsquo;s face&mdash;she had no opinions
      behind people&rsquo;s backs&mdash;about his mastery of his craft; she could
      dispose the floral tributes of homage with a hand of practice all her own.
      She was the reverse of egotistic and never spoke of herself; her success
      in life sprang from a much wiser adoption of pronouns. Waterlow, who liked
      her and had long wanted to paint her ugliness&mdash;it was a gold-mine of
      charm&mdash;had two opinions about her: one of which was that she knew a
      hundred times less than she thought, and even than her brother thought, of
      what she talked about; and the other that she was after all not such a
      humbug as she seemed. She passed in her family for a rank radical, a bold
      Bohemian; she picked up expressions out of newspapers and at the petits
      theatres, but her hands and feet were celebrated, and her behaviour was
      not. That of her sisters, as well, had never been disastrously exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she must be charming, your young lady,&rdquo; she said to Gaston while she
      turned her head this way and that as she stood before Francie&rsquo;s image.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a little Renaissance statuette cast in silver, something of Jean
      Goujon or Germain Pilon.&rdquo; The young men exchanged a glance, for this
      struck them as the happiest comparison, and Gaston replied in a detached
      way that the girl was well worth seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in to have a cup of tea with his sister on the day he knew she
      would have paid her second visit to the studio, and the first words she
      greeted him with were: &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s admirable&mdash;votre petite&mdash;admirable,
      admirable!&rdquo; There was a lady calling in the Place Beauvau at the moment&mdash;old
      Mme. d&rsquo;Outreville&mdash;who naturally asked for news of the object of such
      enthusiasm. Gaston suffered Susan to answer all questions and was
      attentive to her account of the new beauty. She described his young friend
      almost as well as he would have done, from the point of view of her type,
      her graces, her plastic value, using various technical and critical terms
      to which the old lady listened in silence, solemnly, rather coldly, as if
      she thought such talk much of a galimatias: she belonged to the
      old-fashioned school and held a pretty person sufficiently catalogued when
      it had been said she had a dazzling complexion or the finest eyes in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Qu&rsquo;est-ce que c&rsquo;est que cette merveille?&rdquo; she enquired; to which Mme. de
      Brecourt made answer that it was a little American her brother had
      somewhere dug up. &ldquo;And what do you propose to do with it, may one ask?&rdquo;
       Mme. d&rsquo;Outreville demanded, looking at Gaston with an eye that seemed to
      read his secret and that brought him for half a minute to the point of
      breaking out: &ldquo;I propose to marry it&mdash;there!&rdquo; But he contained
      himself, only pleading for the present his wish to ascertain the uses to
      which she was adapted; meanwhile, he added, there was nothing he so much
      liked as to look at her, in the measure in which she would allow him. &ldquo;Ah
      that may take you far!&rdquo; their visitor cried as she got up to go; and the
      young man glanced at his sister to see if she too were ironic. But she
      seemed almost awkwardly free from alarm; if she had been suspicious it
      would have been easier to make his confession. When he came back from
      accompanying their old friend Outreville to her carriage he asked her if
      Waterlow&rsquo;s charming sitter had known who she was and if she had been
      frightened. Mme. de Brecourt stared; she evidently thought that kind of
      sensibility implied an initiation&mdash;and into dangers&mdash;which a
      little American accidentally encountered couldn&rsquo;t possibly have. &ldquo;Why
      should she be frightened? She wouldn&rsquo;t be even if she had known who I was;
      much less therefore when I was nothing for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you weren&rsquo;t nothing for her!&rdquo; the brooding youth declared; and when
      his sister rejoined that he was trop aimable he brought out his lurking
      fact. He had seen the lovely creature more often than he had mentioned; he
      had particularly wished that SHE should see her. Now he wanted his father
      and Jane and Margaret to do the same, and above all he wanted them to like
      her even as she, Susan, liked her. He was delighted she had been taken&mdash;he
      had been so taken himself. Mme. de Brecourt protested that she had
      reserved her independence of judgement, and he answered that if she
      thought Miss Dosson repulsive he might have expressed it in another way.
      When she begged him to tell her what he was talking about and what he
      wanted them all to do with the child he said: &ldquo;I want you to treat her
      kindly, tenderly, for such as you see her I&rsquo;m thinking of bringing her
      into the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t proposed for her?&rdquo; cried Mme. de Brecourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ve sounded her sister as to THEIR dispositions, and she tells
      me that if I present myself there will be no difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her sister?&mdash;the awful little woman with the big head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her head&rsquo;s rather out of drawing, but it isn&rsquo;t a part of the affair.
      She&rsquo;s very inoffensive; she would be devoted to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake then keep quiet. She&rsquo;s as common as a dressmaker&rsquo;s
      bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when you know her. Besides, that has nothing to do with Francie. You
      couldn&rsquo;t find words enough a moment ago to express that Francie&rsquo;s
      exquisite, and now you&rsquo;ll be so good as to stick to that. Come&mdash;feel
      it all; since you HAVE such a free mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call her by her little name like that?&rdquo; Mme. de Brecourt asked,
      giving him another cup of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to you. She&rsquo;s perfectly simple. It&rsquo;s impossible to imagine anything
      better. And think of the delight of having that charming object before
      one&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;always, always! It makes a different look-out for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Brecourt&rsquo;s lively head tossed this argument as high as if she had
      carried a pair of horns. &ldquo;My poor child, what are you thinking of? You
      can&rsquo;t pick up a wife like that&mdash;the first little American that comes
      along. You know I hoped you wouldn&rsquo;t marry at all&mdash;what a pity I
      think it for a man. At any rate if you expect us to like Miss&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      her name?&mdash;Miss Fancy, all I can say is we won&rsquo;t. We can&rsquo;t DO that
      sort of thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall marry her then,&rdquo; the young man returned, &ldquo;without your leave
      given!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. But if she deprives you of our approval&mdash;you&rsquo;ve always
      had it, you&rsquo;re used to it and depend on it, it&rsquo;s a part of your life&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      hate her like poison at the end of a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care then. I shall have always had my month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she&mdash;poor thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing exactly! You&rsquo;ll begin to pity her, and that will make you
      cultivate charity, and cultivate HER WITH it; which will then make you
      find out how adorable she is. Then you&rsquo;ll like her, then you&rsquo;ll love her,
      then you&rsquo;ll see what a perfect sense for the right thing, the right thing
      for ME, I&rsquo;ve had, and we shall all be happy together again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you possibly know, with such people,&rdquo; Mme. de Brecourt
      demanded, &ldquo;what you&rsquo;ve got hold of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By having a feeling for what&rsquo;s really, what&rsquo;s delicately good and
      charming. You pretend to have it, and yet in such a case as this you try
      to be stupid. Give that up; you might as well first as last, for the
      girl&rsquo;s an exquisite fact, she&rsquo;ll PREVAIL, and it will be better to accept
      her than to let her accept you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Brecourt asked him if Miss Dosson had a fortune, and he said he
      knew nothing about that. Her father certainly must be rich, but he didn&rsquo;t
      mean to ask for a penny with her. American fortunes moreover were the last
      things to count upon; a truth of which they had seen too many examples. To
      this his sister had replied: &ldquo;Papa will never listen to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your not finding out, to your not asking for settlements&mdash;comme
      cela se fait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, papa will find out for himself; and he&rsquo;ll know perfectly
      whether to ask or whether to leave it alone. That&rsquo;s the sort of thing he
      does know. And he knows quite as well that I&rsquo;m very difficult to place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be difficult, my dear, if we lose you,&rdquo; Mme. de Brecourt laughed,
      &ldquo;to replace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always at any rate to find a wife for. I&rsquo;m neither fish nor flesh. I&rsquo;ve
      no country, no career, no future; I offer nothing; I bring nothing. What
      position under the sun do I confer? There&rsquo;s a fatuity in our talking as if
      we could make grand terms. You and the others are well enough: qui prend
      mari prend pays, and you&rsquo;ve names about which your husbands take a great
      stand. But papa and I&mdash;I ask you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a family nous sommes tres-bien,&rdquo; said Mme. de Brecourt. &ldquo;You know what
      we are&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t need any explanation. We&rsquo;re as good as anything
      there is and have always been thought so. You might do anything you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall never like to marry&mdash;when it comes to that&mdash;a
      Frenchwoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear&rdquo;&mdash;and Mme. de Brecourt tossed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sister of mine&rsquo;s really French,&rdquo; returned the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No brother of mine&rsquo;s really mad. Marry whomever you like,&rdquo; Susan went on;
      &ldquo;only let her be the best of her kind. Let her be at least a gentlewoman.
      Trust me, I&rsquo;ve studied life. That&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francie&rsquo;s the equal of the first lady in the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that sister&mdash;with that hat? Never&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sister&rsquo;s told a story. It was a document&mdash;it described them, it
      classed them. And such a PATOIS as they speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, her English is quite as good as yours. You don&rsquo;t even know how
      bad yours is,&rdquo; the young man went on with assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Parus&rsquo; and I never asked an Englishman to marry me.
      You know what our feelings are,&rdquo; his companion as ardently pursued; &ldquo;our
      convictions, our susceptibilities. We may be wrong, we may be hollow, we
      may be pretentious, we mayn&rsquo;t be able to say on what it all rests; but
      there we are, and the fact&rsquo;s insurmountable. It&rsquo;s simply impossible for us
      to live with vulgar people. It&rsquo;s a defect, no doubt; it&rsquo;s an immense
      inconvenience, and in the days we live in it&rsquo;s sadly against one&rsquo;s
      interest. But we&rsquo;re made like that and we must understand ourselves. It&rsquo;s
      of the very essence of our nature, and of yours exactly as much as of mine
      or of that of the others. Don&rsquo;t make a mistake about it&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      prepare for yourself a bitter future. I know what becomes of us. We
      suffer, we go through tortures, we die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accent of passionate prophecy was in this lady&rsquo;s voice, but her
      brother made her no immediate answer, only indulging restlessly in several
      turns about the room. At last he took up his hat. &ldquo;I shall come to an
      understanding with her to-morrow, and the next day, about this hour, I
      shall bring her to see you. Meanwhile please say nothing to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Brecourt&rsquo;s eyes lingered on him; he had grasped the knob of the
      door. &ldquo;What do you mean by her father&rsquo;s being certainly rich? That&rsquo;s such
      a vague term. What do you suppose his fortune to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah that&rsquo;s a question SHE would never ask!&rdquo; her brother cried as he left
      her.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning he found himself seated on one of the red-satin sofas
      beside Mr. Dosson in this gentleman&rsquo;s private room at the Hotel de
      l&rsquo;Univers et de Cheltenham. Delia and Francie had established their father
      in the old quarters; they expected to finish the winter in Paris, but had
      not taken independent apartments, for they had an idea that when you lived
      that way it was grand but lonely&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t meet people on the
      staircase. The temperature was now such as to deprive the good gentleman
      of his usual resource of sitting in the court, and he had not yet
      discovered an effective substitute for this recreation. Without Mr. Flack,
      at the cafes, he felt too much a non-consumer. But he was patient and
      ruminant; young Probert grew to like him and tried to invent amusements
      for him; took him to see the great markets, the sewers and the Bank of
      France, and put him, with the lushest disinterestedness, in the way of
      acquiring a beautiful pair of horses, which Mr. Dosson, little as he
      resembles a sporting character, found it a great resource, on fine
      afternoons, to drive with a highly scientific hand and from a smart
      Americaine, in the Bois de Boulogne. There was a reading-room at the
      bankers&rsquo; where he spent hours engaged in a manner best known to himself,
      and he shared the great interest, the constant topic of his daughters&mdash;the
      portrait that was going forward in the Avenue de Villiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the subject round which the thoughts of these young ladies
      clustered and their activity revolved; it gave free play to their faculty
      for endless repetition, for monotonous insistence, for vague and aimless
      discussion. On leaving Mme. de Brecourt Francie&rsquo;s lover had written to
      Delia that he desired half an hour&rsquo;s private conversation with her father
      on the morrow at half-past eleven; his impatience forbade him to wait for
      a more canonical hour. He asked her to be so good as to arrange that Mr.
      Dosson should be there to receive him and to keep Francie out of the way.
      Delia acquitted herself to the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, what have you got to show?&rdquo; asked Francie&rsquo;s father, leaning
      far back on the sofa and moving nothing but his head, and that very
      little, toward his interlocutor. Gaston was placed sidewise, a hand on
      each knee, almost facing him, on the edge of the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To show, sir&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do for a living? How do you subsist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh comfortably enough. Of course it would be remiss in you not to satisfy
      yourself on that point. My income&rsquo;s derived from three sources. First some
      property left me by my dear mother. Second a legacy from my poor brother&mdash;he
      had inherited a small fortune from an old relation of ours who took a
      great fancy to him (he went to America to see her) which he divided among
      the four of us in the will he made at the time of the War.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The war&mdash;what war?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the Franco-German&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh THAT old war!&rdquo; And Mr. Dosson almost laughed. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he mildly
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my father&rsquo;s so good as to make me a decent allowance; and some day I
      shall have more&mdash;from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dosson appeared to think these things over. &ldquo;Why, you seem to have
      fixed it so you live mostly on other folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never attempt to live on you, sir!&rdquo; This was spoken with some
      vivacity by our young man; he felt the next moment that he had said
      something that might provoke a retort. But his companion showed no
      sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess there won&rsquo;t be any trouble about that. And what does my
      daughter say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t spoken to her yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t spoken to the person most interested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it more orthodox to break ground with you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when I was after Mrs. Dosson I guess I spoke to her quick enough,&rdquo;
       Francie&rsquo;s father just a little dryly stated. There was an element of
      reproach in this and Gaston was mystified, for the question about his
      means a moment before had been in the nature of a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will you feel if she won&rsquo;t have you after you&rsquo;ve exposed yourself
      this way to me?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve a sort of confidence. It may be vain, but God grant not! I
      think she likes me personally, but what I&rsquo;m afraid of is that she may
      consider she knows too little about me. She has never seen my people&mdash;she
      doesn&rsquo;t know what may be before her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean your family&mdash;the folks at home?&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you believe that. Delia has moused around&mdash;SHE has found out. Delia&rsquo;s
      thorough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re very simple kindly respectable people, as you&rsquo;ll see in a day
      or two for yourself. My father and sisters will do themselves the honour
      to wait upon you,&rdquo; the young man announced with a temerity the sense of
      which made his voice tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be very happy to see them, sir,&rdquo; his host cheerfully returned.
      &ldquo;Well now, let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; the good gentleman socially mused. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      expect to embrace any regular occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaston smiled at him as from depths. &ldquo;Have YOU anything of that sort,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have me there!&rdquo; Mr. Dosson resignedly sighed. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem
      as if I required anything, I&rsquo;m looked after so well. The fact is the girls
      support me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not expect Miss Francie to support me,&rdquo; said Gaston Probert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re prepared to enable her to live in the style to which she&rsquo;s
      accustomed?&rdquo; And his friend turned on him an eye as of quite patient
      speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll miss anything. That is if she does she&rsquo;ll find
      other things instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume she&rsquo;ll miss Delia, and even me a little,&rdquo; it occurred to Mr.
      Dosson to mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s easy to prevent that,&rdquo; the young man threw off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course we shall be on hand.&rdquo; After which Mr. Dosson continued to
      follow the subject as at the same respectful distance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll continue to
      reside in Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll live anywhere in the world she likes. Of course my people are here&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      a great tie. I&rsquo;m not without hope that it may&mdash;with time&mdash;become
      a reason for your daughter,&rdquo; Gaston handsomely wound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh any reason&rsquo;ll do where Paris is concerned. Take some lunch?&rdquo; Mr.
      Dosson added, looking at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose to their feet, but before they had gone many steps&mdash;the
      meals of this amiable family were now served in an adjoining room&mdash;the
      young man stopped his companion. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how kind I think it&mdash;the
      way you treat me, and how I&rsquo;m touched by your confidence. You take me just
      as I am, with no recommendation beyond my own word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Probert,&rdquo; said his host, &ldquo;if we didn&rsquo;t like you we wouldn&rsquo;t
      smile on you. Recommendations in that case wouldn&rsquo;t be any good. And since
      we do like you there ain&rsquo;t any call for them either. I trust my daughters;
      if I didn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;d have stayed at home. And if I trust them, and they trust
      you, it&rsquo;s the same as if <i>I</i> trusted you, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it is!&rdquo; Gaston delightedly smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion laid a hand on the door, but paused a moment. &ldquo;Now are you
      very sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was, but you make me nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there was a gentleman here last year&mdash;I&rsquo;d have put my money
      on HIM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaston wondered. &ldquo;A gentleman&mdash;last year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Flack. You met him surely. A very fine man. I thought he rather hit
      it off with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seigneur Dieu!&rdquo; Gaston Probert murmured under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dosson had opened the door; he made his companion pass into the small
      dining-room where the table was spread for the noonday breakfast. &ldquo;Where
      are the chickens?&rdquo; he disappointedly asked. His visitor at first supposed
      him to have missed a customary dish from the board, but recognised the
      next moment his usual designation of his daughters. These young ladies
      presently came in, but Francie looked away from the suitor for her hand.
      The suggestion just dropped by her father had given him a shock&mdash;the
      idea of the newspaper-man&rsquo;s personal success with so rare a creature was
      inconceivable&mdash;but her charming way of avoiding his eye convinced him
      he had nothing to really fear from Mr. Flack.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night&mdash;it had been an exciting day&mdash;Delia remarked to her
      sister that of course she could draw back; upon which as Francie repeated
      the expression with her so markedly looser grasp, &ldquo;You can send him a note
      saying you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Delia explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious, no! Won&rsquo;t go to see his sister. You can tell him it&rsquo;s her place
      to come to see you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Francie wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia judged this with all her weight. &ldquo;Is that the way you answered him
      when he asked you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. He could tell you best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to speak to ME that way I guess I&rsquo;d have said &lsquo;Oh well, if
      you don&rsquo;t want it any more than that&mdash;!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wish it WAS you,&rdquo; said Francie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Mr. Probert was me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;that you were the one he&rsquo;s after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francie Dosson, are you thinking of Mr. Flack?&rdquo; her sister suddenly broke
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve ideas and opinions; you know whose place it is and what&rsquo;s due and
      what ain&rsquo;t. You could meet them all,&rdquo; Francie opined.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Delia was indifferent to this tribute. &ldquo;Why how can you say, when
      that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m trying to find out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway; it will never come off,&rdquo; Francie went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll give me up in a few weeks. I&rsquo;ll be sure to do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do something&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that will break the charm,&rdquo; Francie sighed with the sweetest
      feeblest fatalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say that again I shall think you do it on purpose!&rdquo; Delia
      declared. &ldquo;ARE you thinking of George Flack?&rdquo; she repeated in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh do leave him alone!&rdquo; Francie answered in one of her rare irritations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why are you so queer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m tired!&rdquo;&mdash;and the girl turned impatiently away. And this was
      the simple truth; she was tired of the consideration her sister saw fit to
      devote to the question of Gaston&rsquo;s not having, since their return to
      Paris, brought the old folks, as they used to say at home, to see them.
      She was overdone with Delia&rsquo;s theories on this subject, which varied, from
      the view that he was keeping his intercourse with his American friends
      unguessed by them because they were uncompromising in their grandeur, to
      the presumption that that grandeur would descend some day upon the Hotel
      de l&rsquo;Univers et de Cheltenham and carry Francie away in a blaze of glory.
      Sometimes Delia played in her earnest way with the idea that they ought to
      make certain of Gaston&rsquo;s omissions the ground of a challenge; at other
      times she gave her reasons for judging that they ought to take no notice
      of them. Francie, in this connexion, had neither doctrine nor instinct of
      her own; and now she was all at once happy and uneasy, all at once in love
      and in doubt and in fear and in a state of native indifference. Her lover
      had dwelt to her but little on his domestic circle, and she had noticed
      this circumstance the more because of a remark dropped by Charles Waterlow
      to the effect that he and his father were great friends: the word seemed
      to her odd in that application. She knew he saw that gentleman and the
      types of high fashion, as she supposed, Mr. Probert&rsquo;s daughters, very
      often, and she therefore took for granted that they knew he saw her. But
      the most he had done was to say they would come and see her like a shot if
      once they should believe they could trust her. She had wanted to know what
      he meant by their trusting her, and he had explained that it would seem to
      them too good to be true&mdash;that she should be kind to HIM: something
      exactly of that sort was what they dreamed of for him. But they had
      dreamed before and been disappointed and were now on their guard. From the
      moment they should feel they were on solid ground they would join hands
      and dance round her. Francie&rsquo;s answer to this ingenuity was that she
      didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about, and he indulged in no attempt on
      that occasion to render his meaning more clear; the consequence of which
      was that he felt he bore as yet with an insufficient mass, he cut, to be
      plain, a poor figure. His uneasiness had not passed away, for many things
      in truth were dark to him. He couldn&rsquo;t see his father fraternising with
      Mr. Dosson, he couldn&rsquo;t see Margaret and Jane recognising an alliance in
      which Delia was one of the allies. He had answered for them because that
      was the only thing to do, and this only just failed to be criminally
      reckless. What saved it was the hope he founded upon Mme. de Brecourt and
      the sense of how well he could answer to the others for Francie. He
      considered that Susan had in her first judgement of his young lady
      committed herself; she had really taken her in, and her subsequent protest
      when she found what was in his heart had been a denial which he would make
      her in turn deny. The girl&rsquo;s slow sweetness once acting, she would come
      round. A simple interview with Francie would suffice for this result&mdash;by
      the end of half an hour she should be an enthusiastic convert. By the end
      of an hour she would believe she herself had invented the match&mdash;had
      discovered the pearl. He would pack her off to the others as the author of
      the plan; she would take it all upon herself, would represent him even as
      hanging a little back. SHE would do nothing of that sort, but would boast
      of her superior flair, and would so enjoy the comedy as to forget she had
      resisted him even a moment. The young man had a high sense of honour but
      was ready in this forecast for fifty fibs.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It may as well be said at once that his prevision was soon made good and
      that in the course of a fortnight old Mr. Probert and his daughters
      alighted successively at the Hotel de l&rsquo;Univers et de Cheltenham.
      Francie&rsquo;s visit with her intended to Mme. de Brecourt bore exactly the
      fruit her admirer had foretold and was followed the very next day by a
      call from this lady. She took the girl out with her in her carriage and
      kept her the whole afternoon, driving her half over Paris, chattering with
      her, kissing her, delighting in her, telling her they were already
      sisters, paying her compliments that made Francie envy her art of saying
      things as she had never heard things said&mdash;for the excellent reason,
      among many, that she had never known such things COULD be. After she had
      dropped her charge this critic rushed off to her father&rsquo;s, reflecting with
      pleasure that at that hour she should probably find her sister Marguerite
      there. Mme. de Cliche was with their parent in fact&mdash;she had three
      days in the week for coming to the Cours la Reine; she sat near him in the
      firelight, telling him presumably her troubles, for, Maxime de Cliche
      having proved not quite the pearl they had originally supposed, Mme. de
      Brecourt knew what Marguerite did whenever she took that little ottoman
      and drew it close to the paternal chair: she gave way to her favourite
      vice, that of dolefulness, which lengthened her long face more: it was
      unbecoming if she only knew it. The family was intensely united, as we
      see; but that didn&rsquo;t prevent Mme. de Brecourt&rsquo;s having a certain sympathy
      for Maxime: he too was one of themselves, and she asked herself what SHE
      would have done had she been a well-constituted man with a wife whose
      cheeks were like decks in a high sea. It was the twilight hour in the
      winter days, before the lamps, that especially brought her out; then she
      began her long stories about her complicated cares, to which her father
      listened with angelic patience. Mme. de Brecourt liked his particular room
      in the old house in the Cours la Reine; it reminded her of her mother&rsquo;s
      life and her young days and her dead brother and the feelings connected
      with her first going into the world. Alphonse and she had had an
      apartment, by her father&rsquo;s kindness, under the roof that covered in
      associations as the door of a linen-closet preserves herbaceous scents, so
      that she continued to pop in and out, full of her fresh impressions of
      society, just as she had done when she was a girl. She broke into her
      sister&rsquo;s confidences now; she announced her trouvaille and did battle for
      it bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days later&mdash;there had been lively work in the meantime; Gaston
      turned so pale at moments that she feared it would all result in a mortal
      illness for him, and Marguerite shed gallons of tears&mdash;Mr. Probert
      went to see the Dossons with his son. Mme. de Brecourt paid them another
      visit, a real official affair as she deemed it, accompanied by her
      husband; and the Baron de Douves and his wife, written to by Gaston, by
      his father and by Margaret and Susan, came up from the country full of
      anxious participation. M. de Douves was the person who took the family,
      all round, most seriously and who most deprecated any sign of crude or
      precipitate action. He was a very small black gentleman with thick
      eyebrows and high heels&mdash;in the country and the mud he wore sabots
      with straw in them&mdash;who was suspected by his friends of believing
      that he looked like Louis XIV. It is perhaps a proof that something of the
      quality of this monarch was really recognised in him that no one had ever
      ventured to clear up this point by a question. &ldquo;La famille c&rsquo;est moi&rdquo;
       appeared to be his tacit formula, and he carried his umbrella&mdash;he had
      very bad ones, Gaston thought&mdash;with something of a sceptral air. Mme.
      de Brecourt went so far as to believe that his wife, in confirmation of
      this, took herself for a species of Mme. de Maintenon: she had lapsed into
      a provincial existence as she might have harked back to the seventeenth
      century; the world she lived in seemed about as far away. She was the
      largest, heaviest member of the family, and in the Vendee was thought
      majestic despite the old clothes she fondly affected and which added to
      her look of having come down from a remote past or reverted to it. She was
      at bottom an excellent woman, but she wrote roy and foy like her husband,
      and the action of her mind was wholly restricted to questions of
      relationship and alliance. She had extraordinary patience of research and
      tenacity of grasp for a clue, and viewed people solely in the light
      projected upon them by others; that is not as good or wicked, ugly or
      handsome, wise or foolish, but as grandsons, nephews, uncles and aunts,
      brothers and sisters-in-law, cousins and second cousins. You might have
      supposed, to listen to her, that human beings were susceptible of no
      attribute but that of a dwindling or thickening consanguinity. There was a
      certain expectation that she would leave rather formidable memoirs. In
      Mme. de Brecourt&rsquo;s eyes this pair were very shabby, they didn&rsquo;t payer de
      mine&mdash;they fairly smelt of their province; &ldquo;but for the reality of
      the thing,&rdquo; she often said to herself, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re worth all of us. We&rsquo;re
      diluted and they&rsquo;re pure, and any one with an eye would see it.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
      thing&rdquo; was the legitimist principle, the ancient faith and even a little
      the right, the unconscious, grand air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis de Cliche did his duty with his wife, who mopped the decks, as
      Susan said, for the occasion, and was entertained in the red-satin
      drawing-room by Mr. Dosson, Delia and Francie. Mr. Dosson had wanted and
      proposed to be somewhere else when he heard of the approach of Gaston&rsquo;s
      relations, and the fond youth had to instruct him that this wouldn&rsquo;t do.
      The apartment in question had had a range of vision, but had probably
      never witnessed stranger doings than these laudable social efforts. Gaston
      was taught to feel that his family had made a great sacrifice for him, but
      in a very few days he said to himself that now they knew the worst he was
      safe. They made the sacrifice, they definitely agreed to it, but they
      thought proper he should measure the full extent of it. &ldquo;Gaston must
      never, never, never be allowed to forget what we&rsquo;ve done for him:&rdquo; Mme. de
      Brecourt told him that Marguerite de Cliche had expressed herself in that
      sense at one of the family conclaves from which he was absent. These high
      commissions sat for several days with great frequency, and the young man
      could feel that if there was help for him in discussion his case was
      promising. He flattered himself that he showed infinite patience and tact,
      and his expenditure of the latter quality in particular was in itself his
      only reward, for it was impossible he should tell Francie what arts he had
      to practise for her. He liked to think however that he practised them
      successfully; for he held that it was by such arts the civilised man is
      distinguished from the savage. What they cost him was made up simply in
      this&mdash;that his private irritation produced a degree of adoptive heat
      in regard to Mr. Dosson and Delia, whom he could neither justify nor
      coherently account for nor make people like, but whom he had ended after
      so many days of familiar intercourse by liking extremely himself. The way
      to get on with them&mdash;it was an immense simplification&mdash;was just
      to love them: one could do that even if one couldn&rsquo;t converse with them.
      He succeeded in making Mme. de Brecourt seize this nuance; she embraced
      the idea with her quick inflammability. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we must insist
      on their positive, not on their negative merits: their infinite
      generosity, their untutored, their intensely native and instinctive
      delicacy. Ah their charming primitive instincts&mdash;we must work those!&rdquo;
       And the brother and sister excited each other magnanimously to this
      undertaking. Sometimes, it must be added, they exchanged a look that
      seemed to sound with a slight alarm the depth of their responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day Mr. Probert called at the Hotel de l&rsquo;Univers et de Cheltenham
      with his son the pair walked away together, back to the Cours la Reine,
      without immediate comments. The only words uttered were three or four of
      Mr. Probert&rsquo;s, with Gaston&rsquo;s rejoinder, as they crossed the Place de la
      Concorde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should have to have them to dinner.&rdquo; The young man noted his father&rsquo;s
      conditional, as if his assent to the strange alliance were not yet
      complete; but he guessed all the same that the sight of them had not made
      a difference for the worse: they had let the old gentleman down more
      easily than was to have been feared. The call had had above all the
      immense luck that it hadn&rsquo;t been noisy&mdash;a confusion of underbred
      sounds; which was very happy, for Mr. Probert was particular in this: he
      could bear French noise but couldn&rsquo;t for the life of him bear American. As
      for English he maintained that there was no such thing: England was a
      country with the straw down in all the thoroughfares of talk. Mr. Dosson
      had scarcely spoken and yet had remained perfectly placid, which was
      exactly what Gaston would have chosen. No hauteur could have matched it&mdash;he
      had gone so little out of his way. Francie&rsquo;s lover knew moreover&mdash;though
      he was a little disappointed that no charmed exclamation should have been
      dropped as they quitted the hotel&mdash;that the girl&rsquo;s rare spell had
      worked: it was impossible the old man shouldn&rsquo;t have liked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah do ask them, and let it be very soon,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll like it so
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom can they meet&mdash;who can meet THEM?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the family&mdash;all of us: au complet. Other people we can have
      later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of us au complet&mdash;that makes eight. And the three of THEM,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Probert. Then he added: &ldquo;Poor creatures!&rdquo; The fine ironic humane sound
      of it gave Gaston much pleasure; he passed his hand into his father&rsquo;s arm.
      It promised well; it made the intelligent, the tender allowance for the
      dear little Dossons confronted with a row of fierce French critics, judged
      by standards they had never even heard of. The meeting of the two parents
      had not made the problem of their commerce any more clear; but our youth
      was reminded afresh by his elder&rsquo;s hinted pity, his breathed charity, of
      the latent liberality that was really what he had built on. The dear old
      governor, goodness knew, had prejudices and superstitions, but if they
      were numerous, and some of them very curious, they were not rigid. He had
      also such nice inconsistent feelings, such irrepressible indulgences, such
      humorous deviations, and they would ease everything off. He was in short
      an old darling, and with an old darling in the long run one was always
      safe. When they reached the house in the Cours la Reine Mr. Probert said:
      &ldquo;I think you told me you&rsquo;re dining out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with our friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Our friends&rsquo;? Comme vous y allez! Come in and see me then on your
      return; but not later than half-past ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this the young man saw he had swallowed the dose; if he had found it
      refuse to go down he would have cried for relief without delay. This
      reflexion was highly agreeable, for Gaston perfectly knew how little he
      himself would have enjoyed a struggle. He would have carried it through,
      but he couldn&rsquo;t bear to think of that, and the sense of the further
      arguments he was spared made him feel at peace with all the world. The
      dinner at the hotel became the gayest of banquets in honour of this state
      of things, especially as Francie and Delia raved, as they said, about his
      poppa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I expected something nice, but he goes far beyond!&rdquo; Delia declared.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my idea of a real gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah for that&mdash;!&rdquo; said Gaston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too sweet for anything. I&rsquo;m not a bit afraid of him,&rdquo; Francie
      contributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in the world should you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am of you,&rdquo; the girl professed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much you show it!&rdquo; her lover returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;at the bottom of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what a lady should be&mdash;afraid of her lord and master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;m more afraid than that. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were afraid of talking nonsense,&rdquo; said happy Gaston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dosson made no observation whatever about their grave bland visitor;
      he listened in genial unprejudiced silence. It was a sign of his
      prospective son-in-law&rsquo;s perfect comprehension of him that Gaston knew
      this silence not to be in any degree restrictive: it didn&rsquo;t at all mean he
      hadn&rsquo;t been pleased. Mr. Dosson had nothing to say because nothing had
      been given him; he hadn&rsquo;t, like his so differently-appointed young friend,
      a sensitive plate for a brain, and the important events of his life had
      never been personal impressions. His mind had had absolutely no history
      with which anything occurring in the present connexion could be
      continuous, and Mr. Probert&rsquo;s appearance had neither founded a state nor
      produced a revolution. If the young man had asked him how he liked his
      father he would have said at the most: &ldquo;Oh I guess he&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; But
      what was more touchingly candid even than this in Gaston&rsquo;s view was the
      attitude of the good gentleman and his daughters toward the others,
      Mesdames de Douves, de Brecourt and de Cliche and their husbands, who had
      now all filed before them. They believed the ladies and the gentlemen
      alike to have covered them with frank endearments, to have been artlessly
      and gushingly glad to make their acquaintance. They had not in the least
      seen what was manner, the minimum of decent profession, and what the
      subtle resignation of old races who have known a long historical
      discipline and have conventional forms and tortuous channels and grimacing
      masks for their impulses&mdash;forms resembling singularly little the
      feelings themselves. Francie took people at their word when they told her
      that the whole maniere d&rsquo;etre of her family inspired them with an
      irresistible sympathy: that was a speech of which Mme. de Cliche had been
      capable, speaking as if for all the Proberts and for the old noblesse of
      France. It wouldn&rsquo;t have occurred to the girl that such things need have
      been said as for mere frilling and finish. Her lover, whose life affected
      her as a picture, of high price in itself but set in a frame too big and
      too heavy for it, and who therefore might have taken for granted any
      amount of gilding, yet made his reflexions on it now; he noticed how a
      manner might be a very misleading symbol, might cover pitfalls and
      bottomless gulfs, when it had reached that perfection and corresponded so
      little to fact. What he had wanted was that his people should be as easy
      as they could see their way to being, but with such a high standard of
      compliment where after all was sincerity? And without sincerity how could
      people get on together when it came to their settling down to common life?
      Then the Dossons might have surprises, and the surprises would be painful
      in proportion as their present innocence was great. As to the high
      standard itself there was no manner of doubt: there ought to be preserved
      examples of that perfection.

      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When on coming home again this evening, meanwhile, he complied with his
      father&rsquo;s request by returning to the room in which the old man habitually
      sat, Mr. Probert laid down his book and kept on his glasses. &ldquo;Of course
      you&rsquo;ll continue to live with me. You&rsquo;ll understand that I don&rsquo;t consent to
      your going away. You&rsquo;ll have the rooms occupied at first by Susan and
      Alphonse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaston noted with pleasure the transition from the conditional to the
      future tense, and also the circumstance that his father had been lost in a
      book according to his now confirmed custom of evening ease. This proved
      him not too much off the hinge. He read a great deal, and very serious
      books; works about the origin of things&mdash;of man, of institutions, of
      speech, of religion. This habit he had taken up more particularly since
      the circle of his social life had contracted. He sat there alone, turning
      his pages softly, contentedly, with the lamplight shining on his refined
      old head and embroidered dressing-gown. He had used of old to be out every
      night in the week&mdash;Gaston was perfectly aware that to many dull
      people he must even have appeared a little frivolous. He was essentially a
      social creature and indeed&mdash;except perhaps poor Jane in her damp old
      castle in Brittany&mdash;they were all social creatures. That was
      doubtless part of the reason why the family had acclimatised itself in
      France. They had affinities with a society of conversation; they liked
      general talk and old high salons, slightly tarnished and dim, containing
      precious relics, where winged words flew about through a circle round the
      fire and some clever person, before the chimney-piece, held or challenged
      the others. That figure, Gaston knew, especially in the days before he
      could see for himself, had very often been his father, the lightest and
      most amiable specimen of the type that enjoyed easy possession of the
      hearth-rug. People left it to him; he was so transparent, like a glass
      screen, and he never triumphed in debate. His word on most subjects was
      not felt to be the last (it was usually not more conclusive than a
      shrugging inarticulate resignation, an &ldquo;Ah you know, what will you
      have?&rdquo;); but he had been none the less a part of the very prestige of some
      dozen good houses, most of them over the river, in the conservative
      faubourg, and several to-day profaned shrines, cold and desolate hearths.
      These had made up Mr. Probert&rsquo;s pleasant world&mdash;a world not too small
      for him and yet not too large, though some of them supposed themselves
      great institutions. Gaston knew the succession of events that had helped
      to make a difference, the most salient of which were the death of his
      brother, the death of his mother, and above all perhaps the demise of Mme.
      de Marignac, to whom the old boy used still to go three or four evenings
      out of the seven and sometimes even in the morning besides. Gaston fully
      measured the place she had held in his father&rsquo;s life and affection, and
      the terms on which they had grown up together&mdash;her people had been
      friends of his grandfather when that fine old Southern worthy came, a
      widower with a young son and several negroes, to take his pleasure in
      Paris in the time of Louis Philippe&mdash;and the devoted part she had
      played in marrying his sisters. He was quite aware that her friendship and
      all its exertions were often mentioned as explaining their position, so
      remarkable in a society in which they had begun after all as outsiders.
      But he would have guessed, even if he had not been told, what his father
      said to that. To offer the Proberts a position was to carry water to the
      fountain; they hadn&rsquo;t left their own behind them in Carolina; it had been
      large enough to stretch across the sea. As to what it was in Carolina
      there was no need of being explicit. This adoptive Parisian was by nature
      presupposing, but he was admirably urbane&mdash;that was why they let him
      talk so before the fire; he was the oracle persuasive, the conciliatory
      voice&mdash;and after the death of his wife and of Mme. de Marignac, who
      had been her friend too, the young man&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s, he was gentler, if more
      detached, than before. Gaston had already felt him to care in consequence
      less for everything&mdash;except indeed for the true faith, to which he
      drew still closer&mdash;and this increase of indifference doubtless helped
      to explain his present charming accommodation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be thankful for any rooms you may give us,&rdquo; his son said. &ldquo;We
      shall fill out the house a little, and won&rsquo;t that be rather an
      improvement, shrunken as you and I have become?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll fill it out a good deal, I suppose, with Mr. Dosson and the other
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah Francie won&rsquo;t give up her father and sister, certainly; and what
      should you think of her if she did? But they&rsquo;re not intrusive; they&rsquo;re
      essentially modest people; they won&rsquo;t put themselves upon us. They have
      great natural discretion,&rdquo; Gaston declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you answer for that? Susan does; she&rsquo;s always assuring one of it,&rdquo; Mr.
      Probert said. &ldquo;The father has so much that he wouldn&rsquo;t even speak to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t, poor dear man, know what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How then shall I know what to say to HIM?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah you always know!&rdquo; Gaston smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will that help us if he doesn&rsquo;t know what to answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll draw him out. He&rsquo;s full of a funny little shade of bonhomie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t quarrel with your bonhomme,&rdquo; said Mr. Probert&mdash;&ldquo;if
      he&rsquo;s silent there are much worse faults; nor yet with the fat young lady,
      though she&rsquo;s evidently vulgar&mdash;even if you call it perhaps too a
      funny little shade. It&rsquo;s not for ourselves I&rsquo;m afraid; it&rsquo;s for them.
      They&rsquo;ll be very unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; said Gaston. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re too simple. They&rsquo;ll remain so.
      They&rsquo;re not morbid nor suspicious. And don&rsquo;t you like Francie? You haven&rsquo;t
      told me so,&rdquo; he added in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She talks about &lsquo;Parus,&rsquo; my dear boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah to Susan too that seemed the great barrier. But she has got over it. I
      mean Susan has got over the barrier. We shall make her speak French; she
      has a real disposition for it; her French is already almost as good as her
      English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That oughtn&rsquo;t to be difficult. What will you have? Of course she&rsquo;s very
      pretty and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s good. But I won&rsquo;t tell you she is a marvel,
      because you must remember&mdash;you young fellows think your own point of
      view and your own experience everything&mdash;that I&rsquo;ve seen beauties
      without number. I&rsquo;ve known the most charming women of our time&mdash;women
      of an order to which Miss Francie, con rispetto parlando, will never begin
      to belong. I&rsquo;m difficult about women&mdash;how can I help it? Therefore
      when you pick up a little American girl at an inn and bring her to us as a
      miracle, feel how standards alter. J&rsquo;ai vu mieux que ca, mon cher.
      However, I accept everything to-day, as you know; when once one has lost
      one&rsquo;s enthusiasm everything&rsquo;s the same and one might as well perish by the
      sword as by famine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped she&rsquo;d fascinate you on the spot,&rdquo; Gaston rather ruefully
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fascinate&rsquo;&mdash;the language you fellows use! How many times in one&rsquo;s
      life is one likely to be fascinated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;ll charm you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never know at least that she doesn&rsquo;t: I&rsquo;ll engage for that,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Probert handsomely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah be sincere with her, father&mdash;she&rsquo;s worth it!&rdquo; his son broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the elder man took that tone, the tone of vast experience and a
      fastidiousness justified by ineffable recollections, our friend was more
      provoked than he could say, though he was also considerably amused, for he
      had a good while since, made up his mind about the element of rather
      stupid convention in it. It was fatuous to miss so little the fine
      perceptions one didn&rsquo;t have: so far from its showing experience it showed
      a sad simplicity not to FEEL Francie Dosson. He thanked God she was just
      the sort of imponderable infinite quantity, such as there were no stupid
      terms for, that he did feel. He didn&rsquo;t know what old frumps his father
      might have frequented&mdash;the style of 1830, with long curls in front, a
      vapid simper, a Scotch plaid dress and a corsage, in a point suggestive of
      twenty whalebones, coming down to the knees&mdash;but he could remember
      Mme. de Marignac&rsquo;s Tuesdays and Thursdays and Fridays, with Sundays and
      other days thrown in, and the taste that prevailed in that milieu: the
      books they admired, the verses they read and recited, the pictures, great
      heaven! they thought good, and the three busts of the lady of the house in
      different corners (as a Diana, a Druidess and a Croyante: her shoulders
      were supposed to make up for her head), effigies the public ridicule
      attaching to which to-day would&mdash;even the least bad, Canova&rsquo;s&mdash;make
      their authors burrow in holes for shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what else is she worth?&rdquo; Mr. Probert asked after a momentary
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean, what else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her immense prospects, that&rsquo;s what Susan has been putting forward.
      Susan&rsquo;s insistence on them was mainly what brought over Jane. Do you mind
      my speaking of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaston was obliged to recognise privately the importance of Jane&rsquo;s having
      been brought over, but he hated to hear it spoken of as if he were under
      an obligation to it. &ldquo;To whom, sir?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh only to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do less than Mr. Dosson. As I told you, he waived the question
      of money and he was splendid. We can&rsquo;t be more mercenary than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He waived the question of his own, you mean?&rdquo; said Mr. Probert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and of yours. But it will be all right.&rdquo; The young man flattered
      himself that this was as near as he was willing to go to any view of
      pecuniary convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s your affair&mdash;or your sisters&rsquo;,&rdquo; his father returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their idea that we see where we are and that we make the best of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of them to make the best of it and I should think they&rsquo;d
      be tired of their own chatter,&rdquo; Gaston impatiently sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Probert looked at him a moment in vague surprise, but only said: &ldquo;I
      think they are. However, the period of discussion&rsquo;s closed. We&rsquo;ve taken
      the jump.&rdquo; He then added as to put the matter a little less dryly:
      &ldquo;Alphonse and Maxime are quite of your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she&rsquo;s charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound them then, I&rsquo;m not of theirs!&rdquo; The form of this rejoinder was
      childishly perverse, and it made Mr. Probert stare again; but it belonged
      to one of the reasons for which his children regarded him as an old
      darling that Gaston could suppose him after an instant to embrace it. The
      old man said nothing, but took up his book, and his son, who had been
      standing before the fire, went out of the room. His abstention from
      protest at Gaston&rsquo;s petulance was the more generous as he was capable, for
      his part, of feeling it to make for a greater amenity in the whole
      connexion that ces messieurs should like the little girl at the hotel.
      Gaston didn&rsquo;t care a straw what it made for, and would have seen himself
      in bondage indeed had he given a second thought to the question. This was
      especially the case as his father&rsquo;s mention of the approval of two of his
      brothers-in-law appeared to point to a possible disapproval on the part of
      the third. Francie&rsquo;s lover cared as little whether she displeased M. de
      Brecourt as he cared whether she pleased Maxime and Raoul. Mr. Probert
      continued to read, and in a few moments Gaston was with him again. He had
      expressed surprise, just before, at the wealth of discussion his sisters
      had been ready to expend in his interest, but he managed to convey now
      that there was still a point of a certain importance to be made. &ldquo;It seems
      rather odd to me that you should all appear to accept the step I&rsquo;M about
      to take as a necessity disagreeable at the best, when I myself hold that
      I&rsquo;ve been so exceedingly fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Probert lowered his book accommodatingly and rested his eyes on the
      fire. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be content till we&rsquo;re enthusiastic. She seems an amiable
      girl certainly, and in that you&rsquo;re fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you can tell me what would be better&mdash;what you&rsquo;d have
      preferred,&rdquo; the young man said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I should have preferred? In the first place you must remember that I
      wasn&rsquo;t madly impatient to see you married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can imagine that, and yet I can&rsquo;t imagine that as things have turned
      out you shouldn&rsquo;t be struck with my felicity. To get something so charming
      and to get it of our own species!&rdquo; Gaston explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of our own species? Tudieu!&rdquo; said his father, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely it&rsquo;s infinitely fresher and more amusing for me to marry an
      American. There&rsquo;s a sad want of freshness&mdash;there&rsquo;s even a
      provinciality&mdash;in the way we&rsquo;ve Gallicised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against Americans I&rsquo;ve nothing to say; some of them are the best thing
      the world contains. That&rsquo;s precisely why one can choose. They&rsquo;re far from
      doing all like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what, dear father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comme ces gens-la. You know that if they were French, being otherwise
      what they are, one wouldn&rsquo;t look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed one would; they would be such rare curiosities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps they&rsquo;ll do for queer fish,&rdquo; said Mr. Probert with a little
      conclusive sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let them pass at that. They&rsquo;ll surprise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too much, I hope!&rdquo; cried the old man, opening his volume again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complexity of things among the Proberts, it needn&rsquo;t nevertheless
      startle us to learn, was such as to make it impossible for Gaston to
      proceed to the celebration of his nuptial, with all the needful
      circumstances of material preparation and social support, before some
      three months should have expired. He chafed however but moderately under
      this condition, for he remembered it would give Francie time to endear
      herself to his whole circle. It would also have advantages for the
      Dossons; it would enable them to establish by simple but effective arts
      some modus vivendi with that rigid body. It would in short help every one
      to get used to everything. Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s designs and Delia&rsquo;s took no
      articulate form; what was mainly clear to Gaston was that his future
      wife&rsquo;s relatives had as yet no sense of disconnexion. He knew that Mr.
      Dosson would do whatever Delia liked and that Delia would like to &ldquo;start&rdquo;
       her sister&mdash;this whether or no she expected to be present at the rest
      of the race. Mr. Probert notified Mr. Dosson of what he proposed to &ldquo;do&rdquo;
       for his son, and Mr. Dosson appeared more quietly amused than anything
      else at the news. He announced in return no intentions in regard to
      Francie, and his strange silence was the cause of another convocation of
      the house of Probert. Here Mme. de Brecourt&rsquo;s bold front won another
      victory; she maintained, as she let her brother know, that it was too late
      for any policy but a policy of confidence. &ldquo;Lord help us, is that what
      they call confidence?&rdquo; the young man gasped, guessing the way they all had
      looked at each other; and he wondered how they would look next at poor Mr.
      Dosson himself. Fortunately he could always fall back, for reassurance, on
      the perfection of their &ldquo;forms&rdquo;; though indeed he thoroughly knew that
      these forms would never appear so striking as on the day&mdash;should such
      a day fatally come&mdash;of their meddling too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Probert&rsquo;s property was altogether in the United States: he resembled
      other discriminating persons for whom the only good taste in America was
      the taste of invested and paying capital. The provisions he was engaging
      to make for his son&rsquo;s marriage rendered advisable some attention, on the
      spot, to interests with the management of which he was acquainted only by
      report. It had long been his conviction that his affairs beyond the sea
      needed looking into; they had gone on and on for years too far from the
      master&rsquo;s eye. He had thought of making the journey in the cause of that
      vigilance, but now he was too old and too tired and the effort had become
      impossible. There was nothing therefore but for Gaston to go, and go
      quickly, though the time so little fostered his absence from Paris. The
      duty was none the less laid upon him and the question practically faced;
      then everything yielded to the consideration that he had best wait till
      after his marriage, when he might be so auspiciously accompanied by his
      wife. Francie would be in many ways so propitious an introducer. This
      abatement would have taken effect had not a call for an equal energy on
      Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s part suddenly appeared to reach and to move that gentleman.
      He had business on the other side, he announced, to attend to, though his
      starting for New York presented difficulties, since he couldn&rsquo;t in such a
      situation leave his daughters alone. Not only would such a proceeding have
      given scandal to the Proberts, but Gaston learned, with much surprise and
      not a little amusement, that Delia, in consequence of changes now finely
      wrought in her personal philosophy, wouldn&rsquo;t have felt his doing so square
      with propriety. The young man was able to put it to her that nothing would
      be simpler than, in the interval, for Francie to go and stay with Susan or
      Margaret; she herself in that case would be free to accompany her father.
      But Delia declared at this that nothing would induce her to budge from
      Paris till she had seen her sister through, and Gaston shrank from
      proposing that she too should spend five weeks in the Place Beauvau or the
      Rue de Lille. There was moreover a slight element of the mystifying for
      him in the perverse unsociable way in which Francie took up a position of
      marked disfavour as yet to any &ldquo;visiting.&rdquo; AFTER, if he liked, but not
      till then. And she wouldn&rsquo;t at the moment give the reasons of her refusal;
      it was only very positive and even quite passionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this left her troubled suitor no alternative but to say to Mr. Dosson:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, my dear sir, such a fool as I look. If you&rsquo;ll coach me properly,
      and trust me, why shouldn&rsquo;t I rush across and transact your business as
      well as my father&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Strange as it appeared, Francie offered herself as
      accepting this separation from her lover, which would last six or seven
      weeks, rather than accept the hospitality of any member of his family. Mr.
      Dosson, on his side, was grateful for the solution; he remarked &ldquo;Well,
      sir, you&rsquo;ve got a big brain&rdquo; at the end of a morning they spent with
      papers and pencils; and on this Gaston made his preparations to sail.
      Before he left Paris Francie, to do her justice, confided to him that her
      objection to going in such an intimate way even to Mme. de Brecourt&rsquo;s had
      been founded on a fear that in close quarters she might do something that
      would make them all despise her. Gaston replied, in the first place,
      ardently, that this was the very delirium of delicacy, and that he wanted
      to know in the second if she expected never to be at close quarters with
      &ldquo;tous les siens.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah yes, but then it will be safer,&rdquo; she pleaded; &ldquo;then
      we shall be married and by so much, shan&rsquo;t we? be beyond harm.&rdquo; In
      rejoinder to which he had simply kissed her; the passage taking place
      three days before her lover took ship. What further befell in the brief
      interval was that, stopping for a last word at the Hotel de l&rsquo;Univers et
      the Cheltenham on his way to catch the night express to London&mdash;he
      was to sail from Liverpool&mdash;Gaston found Mr. George Flack sitting in
      the red-satin saloon. The correspondent of the Reverberator had come back.
    </p>

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Flack&rsquo;s relations with his old friends didn&rsquo;t indeed, after his
      return, take on the familiarity and frequency of their intercourse a year
      before: he was the first to refer to the marked change in the situation.
      They had got into the high set and they didn&rsquo;t care about the past: he
      alluded to the past as if it had been rich in mutual vows, in pledges now
      repudiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter all the same? Won&rsquo;t you come round there with us some
      day?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson asked; not having perceived for himself any reason why
      the young journalist shouldn&rsquo;t be a welcome and easy presence in the Cours
      la Reine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia wanted to know what Mr. Flack was talking about: didn&rsquo;t he know a
      lot of people that they didn&rsquo;t know and wasn&rsquo;t it natural they should have
      their own society? The young man&rsquo;s treatment of the question was humorous,
      and it was with Delia that the discussion mainly went forward. When he
      maintained that the Dossons had shamelessly &ldquo;shed&rdquo; him Mr. Dosson returned
      &ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;ll grow again!&rdquo; And Francie made the point that it was
      no use for him to pose as a martyr, since he knew perfectly well that with
      all the celebrated people he saw and the way he flew round he had the most
      enchanting time. She was aware of being a good deal less accessible than
      the previous spring, for Mesdames de Brecourt and de Cliche&mdash;the
      former indeed more than the latter&mdash;occupied many of her hours. In
      spite of her having held off, to Gaston, from a premature intimacy with
      his sisters, she spent whole days in their company&mdash;they had so much
      to tell her of how her new life would shape, and it seemed mostly very
      pleasant&mdash;and she thought nothing could be nicer than that in these
      intervals he should give himself to her father, and even to Delia, as had
      been his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the flaw of a certain insincerity in Mr. Flack&rsquo;s nature was suggested
      by his present tendency to rare visits. He evidently didn&rsquo;t care for her
      father in himself, and though this mild parent always took what was set
      before him and never made fusses she is sure he felt their old companion
      to have fallen away. There were no more wanderings in public places, no
      more tryings of new cafes. Mr. Dosson used to look sometimes as he had
      looked of old when George Flack &ldquo;located&rdquo; them somewhere&mdash;as if he
      expected to see their heated benefactor rush back to them with his drab
      overcoat flying in the wind; but this appearance usually and rather
      touchingly subsided. He at any rate missed Gaston because Gaston had this
      winter so often ordered his dinner for him; and his society was not, to
      make it up, sought by the count and the marquis, whose mastery of English
      was small and their other distractions great. Mr. Probert, it was true,
      had shown something of a conversible spirit; he had come twice to the
      hotel since his son&rsquo;s departure and had said, smiling and reproachful,
      &ldquo;You neglect us, you neglect us, my dear sir!&rdquo; The good man had not
      understood what was meant by this till Delia explained after the visitor
      had withdrawn, and even then the remedy for the neglect, administered two
      or three days later, had not borne any copious fruit. Mr. Dosson called
      alone, instructed by his daughter, in the Cours la Reine, but Mr. Probert
      was not at home. He only left a card on which Delia had superscribed in
      advance, almost with the legibility of print, the words &ldquo;So sorry!&rdquo; Her
      father had told her he would give in the card if she wanted, but would
      have nothing to do with the writing. There was a discussion as to whether
      Mr. Probert&rsquo;s remark was an allusion to a deficiency of politeness on the
      article of his sons-in-law. Oughtn&rsquo;t Mr. Dosson perhaps to call
      personally, and not simply through the medium of the visits paid by his
      daughters to their wives, on Messieurs de Brecourt and de Cliche? Once
      when this subject came up in George Flack&rsquo;s presence the old man said he
      would go round if Mr. Flack would accompany him. &ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll go
      right along!&rdquo; Mr. Flack had responded, and this inspiration had become a
      living fact qualified only by the &ldquo;mercy,&rdquo; to Delia Dosson, that the other
      two gentlemen were not at home. &ldquo;Suppose they SHOULD get in?&rdquo; she had said
      lugubriously to her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what if they do?&rdquo; Francie had asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the count and the marquis won&rsquo;t be interested in Mr. Flack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then perhaps he&rsquo;ll be interested in them. He can write something
      about them. They&rsquo;ll like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they would?&rdquo; Delia had solemnly weighed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, if he should say fine things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do like fine things,&rdquo; Delia had conceded. &ldquo;They get off so many
      themselves. Only the way Mr. Flack does it&rsquo;s a different style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, people like to be praised in any style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Delia had continued to brood.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, coming in about three o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Flack found Francie
      alone. She had expressed a wish after luncheon for a couple of hours of
      independence: intending to write to Gaston, and having accidentally missed
      a post, she had determined her letter should be of double its usual
      length. Her companions had respected her claim for solitude, Mr. Dosson
      taking himself off to his daily session in the reading-room of the
      American bank and Delia&mdash;the girls had now at their command a landau
      as massive as the coach of an ambassador&mdash;driving away to the
      dressmaker&rsquo;s, a frequent errand, to superintend and urge forward the
      progress of her sister&rsquo;s wedding-clothes. Francie was not skilled in
      composition; she wrote slowly and had in thus addressing her lover much
      the same sense of sore tension she supposed she should have in standing at
      the altar with him. Her father and Delia had a theory that when she shut
      herself up that way she poured forth pages that would testify to her
      costly culture. When George Flack was ushered in at all events she was
      still bent over her blotting-book at one of the gilded tables, and there
      was an inkstain on her pointed forefinger. It was no disloyalty to Gaston,
      but only at the most an echo as of the sweetness of &ldquo;recess time&rdquo; in old
      school mornings that made her glad to see her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hadn&rsquo;t quite known how to finish her letter, in the infinite of the
      bright propriety of her having written it, but Mr. Flack seemed to set a
      practical human limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have ventured,&rdquo; he observed on entering, &ldquo;to propose this, but
      I guess I can do with it now it&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you do with?&rdquo; she asked, wiping her pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well this happy chance. Just you and me together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s a chance for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for me to be a little less miserable for a quarter of an hour. It
      makes me so to see you look so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes you miserable?&rdquo;&mdash;Francie took it gaily but guardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to understand&mdash;when I say something so noble.&rdquo; And
      settling himself on the sofa Mr. Flack continued: &ldquo;Well, how do you get on
      without Mr. Probert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well indeed, thank you.&rdquo; The tone in which the girl spoke was not an
      encouragement to free pleasantry, so that if he continued his enquiries it
      was with as much circumspection as he had perhaps ever in his life
      recognised himself as having to apply to a given occasion. He was
      eminently capable of the sense that it wasn&rsquo;t in his interest to strike
      her as indiscreet and profane; he only wanted still to appear a real
      reliable &ldquo;gentleman friend.&rdquo; At the same time he was not indifferent to
      the profit for him of her noticing in him a sense as of a good fellow once
      badly &ldquo;sold,&rdquo; which would always give him a certain pull on what he called
      to himself her lovely character. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re in the real &lsquo;grand&rsquo; old
      monde now, I suppose,&rdquo; he resumed at last, not with an air of undue
      derision&mdash;rather with a kind of contemporary but detached
      wistfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m not in anything; I&rsquo;m just where I&rsquo;ve always been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry; I hoped you&rsquo;d tell me a good lot about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Flack,
      not with levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think too much of that. What do you want to know so much about it
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, he took some trouble for his reason. &ldquo;Dear Miss Francie, a poor
      devil of a journalist who has to get his living by studying-up things has
      to think TOO much, sometimes, in order to think, or at any rate to do,
      enough. We find out what we can&mdash;AS we can, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did seem to catch in it the note of pathos. &ldquo;What do you want to
      study-up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything! I take in everything. It all depends on my opportunity. I try
      and learn&mdash;I try and improve. Every one has something to tell&mdash;or
      to sell; and I listen and watch&mdash;well, for what I can drink in or can
      buy. I hoped YOU&rsquo;D have something to tell&mdash;for I&rsquo;m not talking now of
      anything but THAT. I don&rsquo;t believe but what you&rsquo;ve seen a good deal of new
      life. You won&rsquo;t pretend they ain&rsquo;t working you right in, charming as you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean if they&rsquo;ve been kind and sweet to me? They&rsquo;ve been very kind
      and sweet,&rdquo; Francie mid. &ldquo;They want to do even more than I&rsquo;ll let them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah why won&rsquo;t you let them?&rdquo; George Flack asked almost coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do, when it comes to anything,&rdquo; the girl went on. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
      resist them really; they&rsquo;ve got such lovely ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear you talk right out about their ways,&rdquo; her companion
      observed after a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I could talk out right enough if once I were to begin. But I don&rsquo;t see
      why it should interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I care immensely for everything that concerns you? Didn&rsquo;t I tell
      you that once?&rdquo;&mdash;he put it very straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you were foolish ever, and you&rsquo;d be foolish to say it again,&rdquo;
       Francie replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t want to say anything, I&rsquo;ve had my lesson. But I could listen
      to you all day.&rdquo; Francie gave an exclamation of impatience and
      incredulity, and Mr. Flack pursued: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember what you told me
      that time we had that talk at Saint-Germain, on the terrace? You said I
      might remain your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ain&rsquo;t we interested in the development of our friends&mdash;in their
      impressions, their situations and adventures? Especially a person like me,
      who has got to know life whether he wants to or no&mdash;who has got to
      know the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say I could teach you about life?&rdquo; Francie beautifully
      gaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About some kinds certainly. You know a lot of people it&rsquo;s difficult to
      get at unless one takes some extraordinary measures, as you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? What measures have I done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, THEY have&mdash;to get right hold of you&mdash;and its the same
      thing. Pouncing on you, to secure you first&mdash;I call that energetic,
      and don&rsquo;t you think I ought to know?&rdquo; smiled Mr. Flack with much meaning.
      &ldquo;I thought <i>I</i> was energetic, but they got in ahead of me. They&rsquo;re a
      society apart, and they must be very curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re very curious,&rdquo; Francie admitted with a resigned sigh. Then
      she said: &ldquo;Do you want to put them in the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Flack cast about&mdash;the air of the question was so candid,
      suggested so complete an exemption From prejudice. &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m very careful
      about what I put in the paper. I want everything, as I told you; Don&rsquo;t you
      remember the sketch I gave you of my ideals? But I want it in the right
      way and of the right brand. If I can&rsquo;t get it in the shape I like it I
      don&rsquo;t want it at all; first-rate first-hand information, straight from the
      tap, is what I&rsquo;m after. I don&rsquo;t want to hear what some one or other thinks
      that some one or other was told that some one or other believed or said;
      and above all I don&rsquo;t want to print it. There&rsquo;s plenty of that flowing in,
      and the best part of the job&rsquo;s to keep it out. People just yearn to come
      in; they make love to me for it all over the place; there&rsquo;s the biggest
      crowd at the door. But I say to them: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to do something first,
      then I&rsquo;ll see; or at any rate you&rsquo;ve got to BE something!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sometimes see the Reverberator. You&rsquo;ve some fine pieces,&rdquo; Francie
      humanely replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes only? Don&rsquo;t they send it to the old gentleman&mdash;the weekly
      edition? I thought I had fixed that,&rdquo; said George Flack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s usually lying round. But Delia reads it more than I;
      she reads pieces aloud. I like to read books; I read as many as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all literature,&rdquo; said Mr. Flack; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all the press, the
      great institution of our time. Some of the finest books have come out
      first in the papers. It&rsquo;s the history of the age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got the same aspirations,&rdquo; Francie remarked kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same aspirations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those you told me about that day at Saint-Germain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I keep forgetting that I ever broke out to you that way. Everything&rsquo;s
      so changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the proprietor of the paper now?&rdquo; the girl went on, determined
      not to catch this sentimental echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you care? It wouldn&rsquo;t even be delicate in me to tell you; for I
      DO remember the way you said you&rsquo;d try and get your father to help me.
      Don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;ve forgotten it, because you almost made me cry. Anyway,
      that isn&rsquo;t the sort of help I want now and it wasn&rsquo;t the sort of help I
      meant to ask you for then. I want sympathy and interest; I want some one
      to say to me once in a while &lsquo;Keep up your old heart, Mr. Flack; you&rsquo;ll
      come out all right.&rsquo; You see I&rsquo;m a working-man and I don&rsquo;t pretend to be
      anything else,&rdquo; Francie&rsquo;s companion went on. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t live on the
      accumulations of my ancestors. What I have I earn&mdash;what I am I&rsquo;ve
      fought for: I&rsquo;m a real old travailleur, as they say here. I rejoice in it,
      but there&rsquo;s one dark spot in it all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Francie decided not quite at once to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it makes you ashamed of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh how can you say?&rdquo; And she got up as if a sense of oppression, of vague
      discomfort, had come over her. Her visitor troubled such peace as she had
      lately arrived at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed to go round with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Round where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anywhere: just to have one more walk. The very last.&rdquo; George Flack
      had got up too and stood there looking at her with his bright eyes, his
      hands in the pockets of his overcoat. As she hesitated he continued: &ldquo;Then
      I&rsquo;m not such a friend after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rested her eyes a moment on the carpet; then raising them: &ldquo;Where
      would you like to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could render me a service&mdash;a real service&mdash;without any
      inconvenience probably to yourself. Isn&rsquo;t your portrait finished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he won&rsquo;t give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who won&rsquo;t give it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Mr. Waterlow. He wants to keep it near him to look at it in case he
      should take a fancy to change it. But I hope he won&rsquo;t change it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      so lovely as it is!&rdquo; Francie made a mild joke of saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear it&rsquo;s magnificent and I want to see it,&rdquo; said George Flack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go if you&rsquo;ll take me; that&rsquo;s the service you can render me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I thought you went everywhere&mdash;into the palaces of kings!&rdquo;
       Francie cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go where I&rsquo;m welcome, not where I ain&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to push into that
      studio alone; he doesn&rsquo;t want me round. Oh you needn&rsquo;t protest,&rdquo; the young
      man went on; &ldquo;if a fellow&rsquo;s made sensitive he has got to stay so. I feel
      those things in the shade of a tone of voice. He doesn&rsquo;t like
      newspaper-men. Some people don&rsquo;t, you know. I ought to tell you that
      frankly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie considered again, but looking this time at her visitor. &ldquo;Why if it
      hadn&rsquo;t been for you &ldquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid she said &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t have been&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      never have sat to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flack smiled at her in silence for a little. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for me
      I think you&rsquo;d never have met your future husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Francie; and suddenly she blushed red, rather to her
      companion&rsquo;s surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only say that to remind you that after all I&rsquo;ve a right to ask you to
      show me this one little favour. Let me drive with you to-morrow, or next
      day or any day, to the Avenue de Villiers, and I shall regard myself as
      amply repaid. With you I shan&rsquo;t be afraid to go in, for you&rsquo;ve a right to
      take any one you like to see your picture. That&rsquo;s the rule here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh the day you&rsquo;re afraid, Mr. Flack&mdash;!&rdquo; Francie laughed without
      fear. She had been much struck by his reminder of what they all owed him;
      for he truly had been their initiator, the instrument, under providence,
      that had opened a great new interest to them, and as she was more listless
      about almost anything than at the sight of a person wronged she winced at
      his describing himself as disavowed or made light of after the prize was
      gained. Her mind had not lingered on her personal indebtedness to him, for
      it was not in the nature of her mind to linger; but at present she was
      glad to spring quickly, at the first word, into the attitude of
      acknowledgement. It had the effect of simplification after too multiplied
      an appeal&mdash;it brought up her spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I must be quite square with you,&rdquo; the young man said in a tone
      that struck her as &ldquo;higher,&rdquo; somehow, than any she had ever heard him use.
      &ldquo;If I want to see the picture it&rsquo;s because I want to write about it. The
      whole thing will go bang into the Reverberator. You must understand that
      in advance. I wouldn&rsquo;t write about it without seeing it. We don&rsquo;t DO that&rdquo;&mdash;and
      Mr. Flack appeared to speak proudly again for his organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J&rsquo;espere bien!&rdquo; said Francie, who was getting on famously with her
      French. &ldquo;Of course if you praise him Mr. Waterlow will like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that he cares for my praise and I don&rsquo;t care much whether HE
      likes it or not. For you to like it&rsquo;s the principal thing&mdash;we must do
      with that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I shall be awfully proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall speak of you personally&mdash;I shall say you&rsquo;re the prettiest
      girl that has ever come over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say what you like,&rdquo; Francie returned. &ldquo;It will be immense fun to
      be in the newspapers. Come for me at this hour day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too kind,&rdquo; said George Flack, taking up his hat. He smoothed it
      down a moment with his glove; then he said: &ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;ll mind our
      going alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean just you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t you be afraid! Father and Delia have seen it about thirty
      times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be first-rate. And it will help me to feel, more than anything
      else could make me do, that we&rsquo;re still old friends. I couldn&rsquo;t bear the
      end of THAT. I&rsquo;ll come at 3.15,&rdquo; Mr. Flack went on, but without even yet
      taking his departure. He asked two or three questions about the hotel,
      whether it were as good as last year and there were many people in it and
      they could keep their rooms warm; then pursued suddenly, on a different
      plane and scarcely waiting for the girl&rsquo;s answer: &ldquo;And now for instance
      are they very bigoted? That&rsquo;s one of the things I should like to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very bigoted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they tremendous Catholics&mdash;always talking about the Holy
      Father; what they call here the throne and the altar? And don&rsquo;t they want
      the throne too? I mean Mr. Probert, the old gentleman,&rdquo; Mr. Flack added.
      &ldquo;And those grand ladies and all the rest of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very religious,&rdquo; said Francie. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the most religious people
      I ever saw. They just adore the Holy Father. They know him personally
      quite well. They&rsquo;re always going down to Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do they mean to introduce you to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean, to introduce me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why to make you a Catholic, to take you also down to Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;re going to Rome for our voyage de noces!&rdquo; said Francie gaily.
      &ldquo;Just for a peep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t you have to have a Catholic marriage if They won&rsquo;t consent to a
      Protestant one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a lovely one, just like one that Mme. de Brecourt
      took me to see at the Madeleine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will it be at the Madeleine, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, unless we have it at Notre Dame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how will your father and sister like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our having it at Notre Dame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or at the Madeleine. Your not having it at the American church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Delia wants it at the best place,&rdquo; said Francie simply. Then she
      added: &ldquo;And you know poppa ain&rsquo;t much on religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now that&rsquo;s what I call a genuine fact, the sort I was talking
      about,&rdquo; Mr. Flack replied. Whereupon he at last took himself off,
      repeating that he would come in two days later, at 3.15 sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie gave an account of his visit to her sister, on the return of the
      latter young lady, and mentioned the agreement they had come to in
      relation to the drive. Delia brooded on it a while like a sitting hen, so
      little did she know that it was right (&ldquo;as&rdquo; it was right Delia usually
      said) that Francie should be so intimate with other gentlemen after she
      was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Intimate? You wouldn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very intimate if you were to see me!&rdquo;
       Francie cried with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to see you,&rdquo; Delia declared&mdash;the sharpness of
      which made her sister suddenly strenuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delia Dosson, do you realise that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Mr. Flack we
      would never have had that picture, and that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that
      picture I should never have got engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been better if you hadn&rsquo;t, if that&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;re going
      to behave. Nothing would induce me to go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was what suited Francie, but she was nevertheless struck by Delia&rsquo;s
      rigour. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going to take him to see Mr. Waterlow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he become all of a sudden too shy to go alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know Mr. Waterlow has a prejudice against him and has made him
      feel it. You know Gaston told us so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told us HE couldn&rsquo;t bear him; that&rsquo;s what he told us,&rdquo; said Delia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more reason I should be kind to him. Why Delia, do realise,&rdquo;
       Francie went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do,&rdquo; returned the elder girl; &ldquo;but things that are
      very different from those you want me to. You have queer reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve others too that you may like better. He wants to put a piece in the
      paper about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and about me. All about the whole thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delia stared a moment. &ldquo;Well, I hope it will be a good one!&rdquo; she said with
      a groan of oppression as from the crushing majesty of their fate.

    <p>
      When Francie, two days later, passed with Mr. Flack into Charles
      Waterlow&rsquo;s studio she found Mme. de Cliche before the great canvas. She
      enjoyed every positive sign that the Proberts took an interest in her, and
      this was a considerable symptom, Gaston&rsquo;s second sister&rsquo;s coming all that
      way&mdash;she lived over by the Invalides&mdash;to look at the portrait
      once more. Francie knew she had seen it at an earlier stage; the work had
      excited curiosity and discussion among the Proberts from the first of
      their making her acquaintance, when they went into considerations about it
      which had not occurred to the original and her companions&mdash;frequently
      as, to our knowledge, these good people had conversed on the subject.
      Gaston had told her that opinions differed much in the family as to the
      merit of the work, and that Margaret, precisely, had gone so far as to say
      that it might be a masterpiece of tone but didn&rsquo;t make her look like a
      lady. His father on the other hand had no objection to offer to the
      character in which it represented her, but he didn&rsquo;t think it well
      painted. &ldquo;Regardez-moi ca, et ca, et ca, je vous demande!&rdquo; he had
      exclaimed, making little dashes at the canvas with his glove, toward
      mystifying spots, on occasions when the artist was not at hand. The
      Proberts always fell into French when they spoke on a question of art.
      &ldquo;Poor dear papa, he only understands le vieux jeu!&rdquo; Gaston had explained,
      and he had still further to expound what he meant by the old game. The
      brand-newness of Charles Waterlow&rsquo;s game had already been a bewilderment
      to Mr. Probert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie remembered now&mdash;she had forgotten it&mdash;Margaret de
      Cliche&rsquo;s having told her she meant to come again. She hoped the marquise
      thought by this time that, on canvas at least, she looked a little more
      like a lady. Mme. de Cliche smiled at her at any rate and kissed her, as
      if in fact there could be no mistake. She smiled also at Mr. Flack, on
      Francie&rsquo;s introducing him, and only looked grave when, after she had asked
      where the others were&mdash;the papa and the grande soeur&mdash;the girl
      replied that she hadn&rsquo;t the least idea: her party consisted only of
      herself and Mr. Flack. Then Mme. de Cliche&rsquo;s grace stiffened, taking on a
      shade that brought back Francie&rsquo;s sense that she was the individual, among
      all Gaston&rsquo;s belongings, who had pleased her least from the first. Mme. de
      Douves was superficially more formidable, but with her the second
      impression was comparatively comforting. It was just this second
      impression of the marquise that was not. There were perhaps others behind
      it, but the girl hadn&rsquo;t yet arrived at them. Mr. Waterlow mightn&rsquo;t have
      been very much prepossessed with Mr. Flack, but he was none the less
      perfectly civil to him and took much trouble to show him the work he had
      in hand, dragging out canvases, changing lights, moving him off to see
      things at the other end of the great room. While the two gentlemen were at
      a distance Mme. de Cliche expressed to Francie the conviction that she
      would allow her to see her home: on which Francie replied that she was not
      going home, but was going somewhere else with Mr. Flack. And she
      explained, as if it simplified the matter, that this gentleman was a big
      editor. Her sister-in-law that was to be echoed the term and Francie
      developed her explanation. He was not the only big editor, but one of the
      many big editors, of an enormous American paper. He was going to publish
      an article&mdash;as big, as enormous, as all the rest of the business&mdash;about
      her portrait. Gaston knew him perfectly: it was Mr. Flack who had been the
      cause of Gaston&rsquo;s being presented to her. Mme. de Cliche looked across at
      him as if the inadequacy of the cause projected an unfavourable light upon
      an effect hitherto perhaps not exactly measured; she appealed as to
      whether Francie thought Gaston would like her to drive about Paris alone
      with one of ces messieurs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. I never asked him!&rdquo;
       said Francie. &ldquo;He ought to want me to be polite to a person who did so
      much for us.&rdquo; Soon after this Mme. de Cliche retired with no fresh sign of
      any sense of the existence of Mr. Flack, though he stood in her path as
      she approached the door. She didn&rsquo;t kiss our young lady again, and the
      girl observed that her leave-taking consisted of the simple words &ldquo;Adieu
      mademoiselle.&rdquo; She had already noted that in proportion as the Proberts
      became majestic they became articulately French. She and Mr. Flack
      remained in the studio but a short time longer, and when they were seated
      in the carriage again, at the door&mdash;they had come in Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s
      open landau&mdash;her companion said &ldquo;And now where shall we go?&rdquo; He spoke
      as if on their way from the hotel he hadn&rsquo;t touched upon the pleasant
      vision of a little turn in the Bois. He had insisted then that the day was
      made on purpose, the air full of spring. At present he seemed to wish to
      give himself the pleasure of making his companion choose that particular
      alternative. But she only answered rather impatiently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever you like, wherever you like!&rdquo; And she sat there swaying her
      parasol, looking about her, giving no order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Au Bois,&rdquo; said George Flack to the coachman, leaning back on the soft
      cushions. For a few moments after the carriage had taken its easy elastic
      start they were silent; but he soon began again. &ldquo;Was that lady one of
      your new relatives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean one of Mr. Probert&rsquo;s old ones? She&rsquo;s his sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any particular reason in that why she shouldn&rsquo;t say good-morning
      to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t want you to remain with me. She doesn&rsquo;t like you to go round
      with me. She wanted to carry me off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has she got against me?&rdquo; Mr. Flack asked with a kind of portentous
      calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie seemed to consider a little. &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s these funny French ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny? Some of them are very base,&rdquo; said George Flack.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion made no answer; she only turned her eyes to right and left,
      admiring the splendid day and shining city. The great architectural vista
      was fair: the tall houses, with their polished shop-fronts, their
      balconies, their signs with accented letters, seemed to make a glitter of
      gilt and crystal as they rose in the sunny air. The colour of everything
      was cool and pretty and the sound of everything gay; the sense of a costly
      spectacle was everywhere. &ldquo;Well, I like Paris anyway!&rdquo; Francie exhaled at
      last with her little harmonising flatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for you, since you&rsquo;ve got to live here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got to; there&rsquo;s no obligation. We haven&rsquo;t settled anything
      about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t that lady settled it for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very likely she has,&rdquo; said Francie placidly enough. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
      her so well as the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like the others very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. So would you if they had made so much of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one at the studio didn&rsquo;t make much of me, certainly,&rdquo; Mr. Flack
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s the most haughty,&rdquo; Francie allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it all about?&rdquo; her friend demanded. &ldquo;Who are they anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh it would take me three hours to tell you,&rdquo; the girl cheerfully sighed.
      &ldquo;They go back a thousand years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve GOT a thousand years&mdash;I mean three hours.&rdquo; And George
      Flack settled himself more on his cushions and inhaled the pleasant air.
      &ldquo;I AM getting something out of this drive, Miss Francie,&rdquo; he went on.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s many a day since I&rsquo;ve been to the old Bois. I don&rsquo;t fool round much
      in woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie replied candidly that for her too the occasion was most agreeable,
      and Mr. Flack pursued, looking round him with his hard smile, irrelevantly
      but sociably: &ldquo;Yes, these French ideas! I don&rsquo;t see how you can stand
      them. Those they have about young ladies are horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they tell me you like them better after you&rsquo;re married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why after they&rsquo;re married they&rsquo;re worse&mdash;I mean the ideas. Every one
      knows that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they can make you like anything, the way they talk,&rdquo; Francie said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do they talk a great deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should think so. They don&rsquo;t do much else, and all about the
      queerest things&mdash;things I never heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah THAT I&rsquo;ll bet my life on!&rdquo; Mr. Flack returned with understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; his companion obligingly proceeded, &ldquo;&lsquo;ve had most
      conversation with Mr. Probert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, very little with him. I mean with Gaston. But it&rsquo;s not he that has
      told me most&mdash;it&rsquo;s Mme. de Brecourt. She&rsquo;s great on life, on THEIR
      life&mdash;it&rsquo;s very interesting. She has told me all their histories, all
      their troubles and complications.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Complications?&rdquo; Mr. Flack threw off. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she calls them. It
      seems very different from America. It&rsquo;s just like a beautiful story&mdash;they
      have such strange feelings. But there are things you can see&mdash;without
      being told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, like Mme. de Cliche&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; But Francie paused as if for a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her friend was prompt with assistance. &ldquo;Do you mean her complications?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and her husband&rsquo;s. She has terrible ones. That&rsquo;s why one must
      forgive her if she&rsquo;s rather peculiar. She&rsquo;s very unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean through her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he likes other ladies better. He flirts with Mme. de Brives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flack&rsquo;s hand closed over it. &ldquo;Mme. de Brives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s lovely,&rdquo; said Francie. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t very young, but she&rsquo;s
      fearfully attractive. And he used to go every day to have tea with Mme. de
      Villepreux. Mme. de Cliche can&rsquo;t bear Mme. de Villepreux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he seems a kind of MEAN man,&rdquo; George Flack moralised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh his mother was very bad. That was one thing they had against the
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who had?&mdash;against what marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Maggie Probert became engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what they call her&mdash;Maggie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her brother does; but every one else calls her Margot. Old Mme. de Cliche
      had a horrid reputation. Every one hated her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except those, I suppose, who liked her too much!&rdquo; Mr. Flack permitted
      himself to guess. &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s Mme. de Villepreux?&rdquo; he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the daughter of Mme. de Marignac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s THAT old sinner?&rdquo; the young man asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I guess she&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; said Francie. &ldquo;She used to be a great friend of
      Mr. Probert&mdash;of Gaston&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He used to go to tea with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost every day. Susan says he has never been the same since her death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way they do come out with &lsquo;em!&rdquo; Mr. Flack chuckled. &ldquo;And who the
      mischief&rsquo;s Susan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Mme. de Brecourt. Mr. Probert just loved Mme. de Marignac. Mme. de
      Villepreux isn&rsquo;t so nice as her mother. She was brought up with the
      Proberts, like a sister, and now she carries on with Maxime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Maxime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s M. de Cliche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I see&mdash;I see!&rdquo; and George Flack engulfed it. They had reached the
      top of the Champs Elysees and were passing below the wondrous arch to
      which that gentle eminence forms a pedestal and which looks down even on
      splendid Paris from its immensity and across at the vain mask of the
      Tuileries and the river-moated Louvre and the twin towers of Notre Dame
      painted blue by the distance. The confluence of carriages&mdash;a sounding
      stream in which our friends became engaged&mdash;rolled into the large
      avenue leading to the Bois de Boulogne. Mr. Flack evidently enjoyed the
      scene; he gazed about him at their neighbours, at the villas and gardens
      on either hand; he took in the prospect of the far-stretching brown
      boskages and smooth alleys of the wood, of the hour they had yet to spend
      there, of the rest of Francie&rsquo;s pleasant prattle, of the place near the
      lake where they could alight and walk a little; even of the bench where
      they might sit down. &ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; he repeated with appreciation. &ldquo;You
      make me feel quite as if I were in the grand old monde.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day at noon, shortly before the time for which Gaston had announced
      his return, a note was brought Francie from Mme. de Brecourt. It caused
      her some agitation, though it contained a clause intended to guard her
      against vain fears. &ldquo;Please come to me the moment you&rsquo;ve received this&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      sent the carriage. I&rsquo;ll explain when you get here what I want to see you
      about. Nothing has happened to Gaston. We are all here.&rdquo; The coupe from
      the Place Beauvau was waiting at the door of the hotel, and the girl had
      but a hurried conference with her father and sister&mdash;if conference it
      could be called in which vagueness on the one side melted into blankness
      on the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for something bad&mdash;something bad,&rdquo; Francie none
      the less said while she tied her bonnet, though she was unable to think
      what it could be. Delia, who looked a good deal scared, offered to
      accompany her; on which Mr. Dosson made the first remark of a practical
      character in which he had indulged in relation to his daughter&rsquo;s alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t&mdash;no you won&rsquo;t, my dear. They may whistle for Francie,
      but let them see that they can&rsquo;t whistle for all of us.&rdquo; It was the first
      sign he had given of being jealous of the dignity of the Dossons. That
      question had never troubled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what it is,&rdquo; said Delia while she arranged her sister&rsquo;s garments.
      &ldquo;They want to talk about religion. They&rsquo;ve got the priests; there&rsquo;s some
      bishop or perhaps some cardinal. They want to baptise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better take a waterproof!&rdquo; Francie&rsquo;s father called after her
      as she flitted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered, rolling toward the Place Beauvau, what they were all there
      for; that announcement balanced against the reassurance conveyed in the
      phrase about Gaston. She liked them individually, but in their collective
      form they made her uneasy. In their family parties there was always
      something of the tribunal. Mme. de Brecourt came out to meet her in the
      vestibule, drawing her quickly into a small room&mdash;not the salon;
      Francie knew it as her hostess&rsquo;s &ldquo;own room,&rdquo; a lovely boudoir&mdash;in
      which, considerably to the girl&rsquo;s relief, the rest of the family were not
      assembled. Yet she guessed in a moment that they were near at hand&mdash;they
      were waiting. Susan looked flushed and strange; she had a queer smile; she
      kissed her as if she didn&rsquo;t know she was doing it. She laughed as she
      greeted her, but her laugh was extravagant; it was a different
      demonstration every way from any Francie had hitherto had to reckon with.
      By the time our young lady had noted these things she was sitting beside
      her on a sofa and Mme. de Brecourt had her hand, which she held so tight
      that it almost hurt her. Susan&rsquo;s eyes were in their nature salient, but on
      this occasion they seemed to have started out of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re upside down&mdash;terribly agitated. A thunderbolt has fallen on
      the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Francie asked, pale and with
      parted lips. She had a sudden wild idea that Gaston might have found out
      in America that her father had no money, had lost it all; that it had been
      stolen during their long absence. But would he cast her off for that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must understand the closeness of our union with you from our sending
      for you this way&mdash;the first, the only person&mdash;in a crisis. Our
      joys are your joys and our indignations are yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS the matter, PLEASE?&rdquo; the girl repeated. Their &ldquo;indignations&rdquo;
       opened up a gulf; it flashed upon her, with a shock of mortification for
      the belated idea, that something would have come out: a piece in the
      paper, from Mr. Flack, about her portrait and even a little about herself.
      But that was only more mystifying, for certainly Mr. Flack could only have
      published something pleasant&mdash;something to be proud of. Had he by
      some incredible perversity or treachery stated that the picture was bad,
      or even that SHE was? She grew dizzy, remembering how she had refused him,
      and how little he had liked it, that day at Saint-Germain. But they had
      made that up over and over, especially when they sat so long on a bench
      together (the time they drove) in the Bois de Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh the most awful thing; a newspaper sent this morning from America to my
      father&mdash;containing two horrible columns of vulgar lies and scandal
      about our family, about all of us, about you, about your picture, about
      poor Marguerite, calling her &lsquo;Margot,&rsquo; about Maxime and Leonie de
      Villepreux, saying he&rsquo;s her lover, about all our affairs, about Gaston,
      about your marriage, about your sister and your dresses and your dimples,
      about our darling father, whose history it professes to relate in the most
      ignoble, the most revolting terms. Papa&rsquo;s in the most awful state!&rdquo; and
      Mme. de Brecourt panted to take breath. She had spoken with the volubility
      of horror and passion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re outraged with us and you must suffer with
      us,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;But who has done it? Who has done it? Who has done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Mr. Flack&mdash;Mr. Flack!&rdquo; Francie quickly replied. She was
      appalled, overwhelmed; but her foremost feeling was the wish not to appear
      to disavow her knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Flack? do you mean that awful person&mdash;? He ought to be shot, he
      ought to be burnt alive. Maxime will kill him, Maxime&rsquo;s in an unspeakable
      rage. Everything&rsquo;s at end, we&rsquo;ve been served up to the rabble, we shall
      have to leave Paris. How could he know such things?&mdash;and they all so
      infamously false!&rdquo; The poor woman poured forth her woe in questions,
      contradictions, lamentations; she didn&rsquo;t know what to ask first, against
      what to protest. &ldquo;Do you mean that wretch Marguerite saw you with at Mr.
      Waterlow&rsquo;s? Oh Francie, what has happened? She had a feeling then, a
      dreadful foreboding. She saw you afterwards&mdash;walking with him&mdash;in
      the Bois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t see her,&rdquo; the girl said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were talking with him&mdash;you were too absorbed: that&rsquo;s what Margot
      remembers. Oh Francie, Francie!&rdquo; wailed Mme. de Brecourt, whose distress
      was pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She tried to interfere at the studio, but I wouldn&rsquo;t let her. He&rsquo;s an old
      friend&mdash;a friend of poppa&rsquo;s&mdash;and I like him very much. What my
      father allows, that&rsquo;s not for others to criticise!&rdquo; Francie continued. She
      was frightened, extremely frightened, at her companion&rsquo;s air of tragedy
      and at the dreadful consequences she alluded to, consequences of an act
      she herself didn&rsquo;t know, couldn&rsquo;t comprehend nor measure yet. But there
      was an instinct of bravery in her which threw her into blind defence,
      defence even of George Flack, though it was a part of her consternation
      that on her too he should have practised a surprise&mdash;it would appear
      to be some self-seeking deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh how can you bear with such brutes, how can your father&mdash;? What
      devil has he paid to tattle to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scare me awfully&mdash;you terrify me,&rdquo; the girl could but plead. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I haven&rsquo;t seen it, I don&rsquo;t
      understand it. Of course I&rsquo;ve talked to Mr. Flack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Francie, don&rsquo;t say it&mdash;don&rsquo;t SAY it! Dear child, you haven&rsquo;t
      talked to him in that fashion: vulgar horrors and such a language!&rdquo; Mme.
      de Brecourt came nearer, took both her hands now, drew her closer, seemed
      to supplicate her for some disproof, some antidote to the nightmare. &ldquo;You
      shall see the paper; they&rsquo;ve got it in the other room&mdash;the most
      disgusting sheet. Margot&rsquo;s reading it to her husband; he can&rsquo;t read
      English, if you can call it English: such a style of the gutter! Papa
      tried to translate it to Maxime, but he couldn&rsquo;t, he was too sick. There&rsquo;s
      a quantity about Mme. de Marignac&mdash;imagine only! And a quantity about
      Jeanne and Raoul and their economies in the country. When they see it in
      Brittany&mdash;heaven preserve us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie had turned very white; she looked for a minute at the carpet. &ldquo;And
      what does it say about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some trash about your being the great American beauty, with the most
      odious details, and your having made a match among the &lsquo;rare old
      exclusives.&rsquo; And the strangest stuff about your father&mdash;his having
      gone into a &lsquo;store&rsquo; at the age of twelve. And something about your poor
      sister&mdash;heaven help us! And a sketch of our career in Paris, as they
      call it, and the way we&rsquo;ve pushed and got on and our ridiculous
      pretensions. And a passage about Blanche de Douves, Raoul&rsquo;s sister, who
      had that disease&mdash;what do they call it?&mdash;that she used to steal
      things in shops: do you see them reading THAT? And how did he know such a
      thing? It&rsquo;s ages ago, it&rsquo;s dead and buried!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me, you told me yourself,&rdquo; said Francie quickly. She turned red
      the instant she had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s YOU&mdash;don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, my darling!&rdquo; cried Mme. de
      Brecourt, who had stared and glared at her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want, that&rsquo;s
      what you must do, that&rsquo;s what I see you this way for first alone. I&rsquo;ve
      answered for you, you know; you must repudiate the remotest connexion; you
      must deny it up to the hilt. Margot suspects you&mdash;she has got that
      idea&mdash;she has given it to the others. I&rsquo;ve told them they ought to be
      ashamed, that it&rsquo;s an outrage to all we know you and love you for. I&rsquo;ve
      done everything for the last hour to protect you. I&rsquo;m your godmother, you
      know, and you mustn&rsquo;t disappoint me. You&rsquo;re incapable, and you must say
      so, face to face, to my father. Think of Gaston, cherie; HE&rsquo;LL have seen
      it over there, alone, far from us all. Think of HIS horror and of HIS
      anguish and of HIS faith, of what HE would expect of you.&rdquo; Mme. de
      Brecourt hurried on, and her companion&rsquo;s bewilderment deepened to see how
      the tears had risen to her eyes and were pouring down her cheeks. &ldquo;You
      must say to my father, face to face, that you&rsquo;re incapable&mdash;that
      you&rsquo;re stainless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stainless?&rdquo; Francie bleated it like a bewildered interrogative lamb. But
      the sheep-dog had to be faced. &ldquo;Of course I knew he wanted to write a
      piece about the picture&mdash;and about my marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your marriage&mdash;of course you knew? Then, wretched girl, you&rsquo;re
      at the bottom of ALL!&rdquo; cried Mme. de Brecourt, flinging herself away,
      falling back on the sofa, prostrate there and covering her face with her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me&mdash;he told me when I went with him to the studio!&rdquo; Francie
      asseverated loud. &ldquo;But he seems to have printed more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MORE? I should think so!&rdquo; And Mme. de Brecourt rebounded, standing before
      her. &ldquo;And you LET him&mdash;about yourself? You gave him preposterous
      facts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him&mdash;I told him&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what. It was for his paper&mdash;he
      wants everything. It&rsquo;s a very fine paper,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fine paper?&rdquo; Mme. de Brecourt flushed, with parted lips. &ldquo;Have you
      SEEN, have you touched the hideous sheet? Ah my brother, my brother!&rdquo; she
      quavered again, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your brother were here you wouldn&rsquo;t talk to me this way&mdash;he&rsquo;d
      protect me, Gaston would!&rdquo; cried Francie, on her feet, seizing her little
      muff and moving to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, go away or they&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; her friend went on excitedly.
      &ldquo;After all I&rsquo;ve done for you&mdash;after the way I&rsquo;ve lied for you!&rdquo; And
      she sobbed, trying to repress her sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie, at this, broke out into a torrent of tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go home. Poppa,
      poppa!&rdquo; she almost shrieked, reaching the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh your father&mdash;he has been a nice father, bringing you up in such
      ideas!&rdquo; These words followed her with infinite scorn, but almost as Mme.
      de Brecourt uttered them, struck by a sound, she sprang after the girl,
      seized her, drew her back and held her a moment listening before she could
      pass out. &ldquo;Hush&mdash;hush&mdash;they&rsquo;re coming in here, they&rsquo;re too
      anxious! Deny&mdash;deny it&mdash;say you know nothing! Your sister must
      have said things&mdash;and such things: say it all comes from HER!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you dreadful&mdash;is that what YOU do?&rdquo; cried Francie, shaking
      herself free. The door opened as she spoke and Mme. de Brecourt walked
      quickly to the window, turning her back. Mme. de Cliche was there and Mr.
      Probert and M. de Brecourt and M. de Cliche. They entered in silence and
      M. de Brecourt, coming last, closed the door softly behind him. Francie
      had never been in a court of justice, but if she had had that experience
      these four persons would have reminded her of the jury filing back into
      their box with their verdict. They all looked at her hard as she stood in
      the middle of the room; Mme. de Brecourt gazed out of the window, wiping
      her tears; Mme. de Cliche grasped a newspaper, crumpled and partly folded.
      Francie got a quick impression, moving her eyes from one face to another,
      that old Mr. Probert was the worst; his mild ravaged expression was
      terrible. He was the one who looked at her least; he went to the fireplace
      and leaned on the mantel with his head in his hands. He seemed ten years
      older.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah mademoiselle, mademoiselle, mademoiselle!&rdquo; said Maxime de Cliche
      slowly, impressively, in a tone of the most respectful but most poignant
      reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen it&mdash;have they sent it to you&mdash;?&rdquo; his wife asked,
      thrusting the paper toward her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite at your service!&rdquo; But as
      Francie neither spoke nor took it she tossed it upon the sofa, where, as
      it opened, falling, the girl read the name of the Reverberator. Mme. de
      Cliche carried her head very far aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has nothing to do with it&mdash;it&rsquo;s just as I told you&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      overwhelmed,&rdquo; said Mme. de Brecourt, remaining at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d do well to read it&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth the trouble,&rdquo; Alphonse de
      Brecourt remarked, going over to his wife. Francie saw him kiss her as he
      noted her tears. She was angry at her own; she choked and swallowed them;
      they seemed somehow to put her in the wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had no idea that any such monstrosity would be perpetrated?&rdquo;
       Mme. de Cliche went on, coming nearer to her. She had a manner of forced
      calmness&mdash;as if she wished it to be understood that she was one of
      those who could be reasonable under any provocation, though she were
      trembling within&mdash;which made Francie draw back. &ldquo;C&rsquo;est pourtant
      rempli de choses&mdash;which we know you to have been told of&mdash;by
      what folly, great heaven! It&rsquo;s right and left&mdash;no one&rsquo;s spared&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a deluge of the lowest insult. My sister perhaps will have told you of the
      apprehensions I had&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t resist them, though I thought of
      nothing so awful as this, God knows&mdash;the day I met you at Mr.
      Waterlow&rsquo;s with your journalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told her everything&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see she&rsquo;s aneantie? Let her go,
      let her go!&rdquo; cried Mme. de Brecourt all distrustfully and still at the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah your journalist, your journalist, mademoiselle!&rdquo; said Maxime de
      Cliche. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to have to say anything in regard to any friend of
      yours that can give you so little pleasure; but I promise myself the
      satisfaction of administering him with these hands a dressing he won&rsquo;t
      forget, if I may trouble you so far as to ask you to let him know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Cliche fingered the points of his moustache; he diffused some
      powerful scent; his eyes were dreadful to Francie. She wished Mr. Probert
      would say something kind to her; but she had now determined to be strong.
      They were ever so many against one; Gaston was far away and she felt
      heroic. &ldquo;If you mean Mr. Flack&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; she said
      as composedly as possible to M. de Cliche. &ldquo;Mr. Flack has gone to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this M. de Brecourt gave a free laugh and his brother-in-law replied:
      &ldquo;Ah it&rsquo;s easy to go to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They like such things there; they do them more and more. It&rsquo;s as bad as
      America!&rdquo; Mme. de Cliche declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you sent for me&mdash;what do you all want me to do? You might
      explain&mdash;I&rsquo;m only an American girl!&rdquo; said Francie, whose being only
      an American girl didn&rsquo;t prevent her pretty head from holding itself now as
      high as Mme. de Cliche&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Brecourt came back to her quickly, laying her hand on her arm.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very nervous&mdash;you&rsquo;d much better go home. I&rsquo;ll explain
      everything to them&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make them understand. The carriage is here&mdash;it
      had orders to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the least nervous, but I&rsquo;ve made you all so,&rdquo; Francie brought
      out with the highest spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defend you, my dear young lady&mdash;I insist that you&rsquo;re only a
      wretched victim like ourselves,&rdquo; M. de Brecourt remarked, approaching her
      with a smile. &ldquo;I see the hand of a woman in it, you know,&rdquo; he went on to
      the others; &ldquo;for there are strokes of a vulgarity that a man doesn&rsquo;t sink
      to&mdash;he can&rsquo;t, his very organisation prevents him&mdash;even if he be
      the dernier des goujats. But please don&rsquo;t doubt that I&rsquo;ve maintained that
      woman not to be you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way you talk! <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know how to write,&rdquo; Francie impatiently
      quavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child, when one knows you as I do&mdash;!&rdquo; murmured Mme. de
      Brecourt with an arm round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady who helps him&mdash;Mr. Flack has told me so,&rdquo; the girl
      continued. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a literary lady&mdash;here in Paris&mdash;she writes
      what he tells her. I think her name&rsquo;s Miss Topping, but she calls herself
      Florine&mdash;or Dorine,&rdquo; Francie added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dosson, you&rsquo;re too rare!&rdquo; Marguerite de Cliche exclaimed, giving a
      long moan of pain which ended in an incongruous laugh. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been
      three to it,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;that accounts for its perfection!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie disengaged herself again from Mme. de Brecourt and went to Mr.
      Probert, who stood looking down at the fire with his back to her. &ldquo;Mr.
      Probert, I&rsquo;m very sorry for what I&rsquo;ve done to distress you; I had no idea
      you&rsquo;d all feel so badly. I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm. I thought you&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man turned a little, bending his eyes on her, but without taking
      her hand as she had hoped. Usually when they met he kissed her. He didn&rsquo;t
      look angry now, he only looked very ill. A strange, inarticulate sound, a
      chorus of amazement and mirth, came from the others when she said she
      thought they&rsquo;d like it; and indeed poor Francie was far from being able to
      measure the droll effect of that speech. &ldquo;Like it&mdash;LIKE IT?&rdquo; said Mr.
      Probert, staring at her as if a little afraid of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? She admits&mdash;she admits!&rdquo; Mme. de Cliche exulted to
      her sister. &ldquo;Did you arrange it all that day in the Bois&mdash;to punish
      me for having tried to separate you?&rdquo; she pursued to the poor child, who
      stood gazing up piteously at the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he has published&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t seen it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      understand. I thought it was only to be a piece about me,&rdquo; she said to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;About me&rsquo;!&rdquo; M. de Cliche repeated in English. &ldquo;Elle est divine!&rdquo; He
      turned away, raising his shoulders and hands and then letting them fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Brecourt had picked up the newspaper; she rolled it together,
      saying to Francie that she must take it home, take it home immediately&mdash;then
      she&rsquo;d see. She only seemed to wish to get her out of the room. But Mr.
      Probert had fixed their flushed little guest with his sick stare. &ldquo;You
      gave information for that? You desired it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t desire it&mdash;but Mr. Flack did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you know such ruffians? Where was your father?&rdquo; the old man
      groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d just be nice about my picture and give pleasure to Mr.
      Waterlow,&rdquo; Francie went on. &ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d just speak about my being
      engaged and give a little account; so many people in America would be
      interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So many people in America&mdash;that&rsquo;s just the dreadful thought, my
      dear,&rdquo; said Mme. de Brecourt kindly. &ldquo;Foyons, put it in your muff and tell
      us what you think of it.&rdquo; And she continued to thrust forward the
      scandalous journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Francie took no notice of it; she looked round from Mr. Probert at the
      others. &ldquo;I told Gaston I&rsquo;d certainly do something you wouldn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll believe it now!&rdquo; cried Mme. de Cliche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child, do you think he&rsquo;ll like it any better?&rdquo; asked Mme. de
      Brecourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie turned upon her beautiful dilated eyes in which a world of new
      wonders and fears had suddenly got itself reflected. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see it over
      there&mdash;he has seen it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh my dear, you&rsquo;ll have news of him. Don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo; broke in high
      derision from Mme. de Cliche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did HE send you the paper?&rdquo; her young friend went on to Mr. Probert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not directed in his hand,&rdquo; M. de Brecourt pronounced. &ldquo;There was
      some stamp on the band&mdash;it came from the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Flack&mdash;is that his hideous name?&mdash;must have seen to that,&rdquo;
       Mme. de Brecourt suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or perhaps Florine,&rdquo; M. de Cliche interposed. &ldquo;I should like to get hold
      of Florine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I DID&mdash;I did tell him so!&rdquo; Francie repeated with all her fevered
      candour, alluding to her statement of a moment before and speaking as if
      she thought the circumstance detracted from the offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I&mdash;so did we all!&rdquo; said Mme. de Cliche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will he suffer&mdash;as you suffer?&rdquo; Francie continued, appealing to
      Mr. Probert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suffer, suffer? He&rsquo;ll die!&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;However, I won&rsquo;t answer
      for him; he&rsquo;ll tell you himself, when he returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll die?&rdquo; echoed Francie with the eyes of a child at the pantomime who
      has found the climax turning to demons or monsters or too much gunpowder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never return&mdash;how can he show himself?&rdquo; said Mme. de Cliche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true&mdash;he&rsquo;ll come back to stand by me!&rdquo; the girl flashed
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How couldn&rsquo;t you feel us to be the last&mdash;the very last?&rdquo; asked Mr.
      Probert with great gentleness. &ldquo;How couldn&rsquo;t you feel my poor son to be
      the last&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C&rsquo;est un sens qui lui manque!&rdquo; shrilled implacably Mme. de Cliche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her go, papa&mdash;do let her go home,&rdquo; Mme. de Brecourt pleaded.
      &ldquo;Surely. That&rsquo;s the only place for her to-day,&rdquo; the elder sister
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my child&mdash;you oughtn&rsquo;t to be here. It&rsquo;s your father&mdash;he
      ought to understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Probert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t send for him&mdash;let it all stop!&rdquo; And Mme. de
      Cliche made wild gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie looked at her as she had never looked at any one in her life, and
      then said: &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Probert&mdash;good-bye, Susan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her your arm&mdash;take her to the carriage,&rdquo; she heard Mme. de
      Brecourt growl to her husband. She got to the door she hardly knew how&mdash;she
      was only conscious that Susan held her once more long enough to kiss her.
      Poor Susan wanted to comfort her; that showed how bad&mdash;feeling as she
      did&mdash;she believed the whole business would yet be. It would be bad
      because Gaston, Gaston&mdash;! Francie didn&rsquo;t complete that thought, yet
      only Gaston was in her mind as she hurried to the carriage. M. de Brecourt
      hurried beside her; she wouldn&rsquo;t take his arm. But he opened the door for
      her and as she got in she heard him murmur in the strangest and most
      unexpected manner: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re charming, mademoiselle&mdash;charming,
      charming!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her absence had not been long and when she re-entered the familiar salon
      at the hotel she found her father and sister sitting there together as if
      they had timed her by their watches, a prey, both of them, to curiosity
      and suspense. Mr. Dosson however gave no sign of impatience; he only
      looked at her in silence through the smoke of his cigar&mdash;he profaned
      the red satin splendour with perpetual fumes&mdash;as she burst into the
      room. An irruption she made of her desired reappearance; she rushed to one
      of the tables, flinging down her muff and gloves, while Delia, who had
      sprung up as she came in, caught her closely and glared into her face with
      a &ldquo;Francie Dosson, what HAVE you been through?&rdquo; Francie said nothing at
      first, only shutting her eyes and letting her sister do what she would
      with her. &ldquo;She has been crying, poppa&mdash;she HAS,&rdquo; Delia almost
      shouted, pulling her down upon a sofa and fairly shaking her as she
      continued. &ldquo;Will you please tell? I&rsquo;ve been perfectly wild! Yes you have,
      you dreadful&mdash;!&rdquo; the elder girl insisted, kissing her on the eyes.
      They opened at this compassionate pressure and Francie rested their
      troubled light on her father, who had now risen to his feet and stood with
      his back to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, chicken,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson, &ldquo;you look as if you had had quite a
      worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I should&mdash;I told you, I told you!&rdquo; Francie broke out with
      a trembling voice. &ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;ve DONE anything?&rdquo; cried Delia, very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over, it&rsquo;s all over!&rdquo; With which Francie&rsquo;s face braved denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you crazy, Francie?&rdquo; Delia demanded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you look as if you
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you going to be married, childie?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dosson all
      considerately, but coming nearer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie sprang up, releasing herself from her sister, and threw her arms
      round him. &ldquo;Will you take me away, poppa? will you take me right straight
      away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will, my precious. I&rsquo;ll take you anywhere. I don&rsquo;t want
      anything&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t MY idea!&rdquo; And Mr. Dosson and Delia looked at each
      other while the girl pressed her face upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard such trash&mdash;you can&rsquo;t behave that way! Has he got
      engaged to some one else&mdash;in America?&rdquo; Delia threw out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why if it&rsquo;s over it&rsquo;s over. I guess it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson,
      kissing his younger daughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back or I&rsquo;ll go on. I&rsquo;ll go
      anywhere you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have your daughters insulted, I presume!&rdquo; Delia cried. &ldquo;If you
      don&rsquo;t tell me this moment what has happened,&rdquo; she pursued to her sister,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive straight round there and make THEM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HAVE they insulted you, sweetie?&rdquo; asked the old man, bending over his
      child, who simply leaned on him with her hidden face and no sound of
      tears. Francie raised her head, turning round to their companion. &ldquo;Did I
      ever tell you anything else&mdash;did I ever believe in it for an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, if you&rsquo;ve done it on purpose to triumph over me we might as well
      go home, certainly. But I guess,&rdquo; Delia added, &ldquo;you had better just wait
      till Gaston comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be worse when he comes&mdash;if he thinks the same as they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HAVE they insulted you&mdash;have they?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson repeated while the
      smoke of his cigar, curling round the question, gave him the air of
      putting it with placidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They think I&rsquo;ve insulted THEM&mdash;they&rsquo;re in an awful state&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      almost dead. Mr. Flack has put it into the paper&mdash;everything, I don&rsquo;t
      know what&mdash;and they think it&rsquo;s too wicked. They were all there
      together&mdash;all at me at once, weeping and wailing and gnashing their
      teeth. I never saw people so affected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delia&rsquo;s face grew big with her stare. &ldquo;So affected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, I guess there&rsquo;s a good deal OF THAT,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too real&mdash;too terrible; you don&rsquo;t understand. It&rsquo;s all printed
      there&mdash;that they&rsquo;re immoral, and everything about them; everything
      that&rsquo;s private and dreadful,&rdquo; Francie explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immoral, is that so?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson threw off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And about me too, and about Gaston and my marriage, and all sorts of
      personalities, and all the names, and Mme. de Villepreux, and everything.
      It&rsquo;s all printed there and they&rsquo;ve read it. It says one of them steals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be so good as to tell me what you&rsquo;re talking about?&rdquo; Delia
      enquired sternly. &ldquo;Where is it printed and what have we got to do with
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one sent it, and I told Mr. Flack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean HIS paper? Oh the horrid ape!&rdquo; Delia cried with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they mind so what they see in the papers?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dosson. &ldquo;I guess
      they haven&rsquo;t seen what I&rsquo;ve seen. Why there used to be things about ME&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it IS about us too&mdash;about every one. They think it&rsquo;s the same
      as if I wrote it,&rdquo; Francie ruefully mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know what you COULD do!&rdquo; And Mr. Dosson beamed at her for
      common cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that piece about your picture&mdash;that you told me about
      when you went with him again to see it?&rdquo; Delia demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know what piece it is; I haven&rsquo;t seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen it? Didn&rsquo;t they show it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I couldn&rsquo;t read it. Mme. de Brecourt wanted me to take it&mdash;but
      I left it behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s LIKE you&mdash;like the Tauchnitzes littering up our track.
      I&rsquo;ll be bound I&rsquo;d see it,&rdquo; Delia declared. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it come, doesn&rsquo;t it
      always come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we haven&rsquo;t had the last&mdash;unless it&rsquo;s somewhere round,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Dosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poppa, go out and get it&mdash;you can buy it on the boulevard!&rdquo; Delia
      continued. &ldquo;Francie, what DID you want to tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. I was just conversing. He seemed to take so much
      interest,&rdquo; Francie pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh he&rsquo;s a deep one!&rdquo; groaned Delia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if folks are immoral you can&rsquo;t keep it out of the papers&mdash;and
      I don&rsquo;t know as you ought to want to,&rdquo; Mr. Dosson remarked. &ldquo;If they ARE
      I&rsquo;m glad to know it, lovey.&rdquo; And he gave his younger daughter a glance
      apparently intended to show that in this case he should know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Francie was looking at her sister as if her attention had been
      arrested. &ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;&lsquo;a deep one&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why he wanted to break it off, the fiend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie stared; then a deeper flush leapt to her face, already mottled as
      with the fine footprints of the Proberts, dancing for pain. &ldquo;To break off
      my engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just that. But I&rsquo;ll be hanged if he shall. Poppa, will you allow
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Mr. Flack&rsquo;s vile interference. You won&rsquo;t let him do as he likes with
      us, I suppose, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all done&mdash;it&rsquo;s all done!&rdquo; said Francie. The tears had suddenly
      started into her eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s so smart that it IS likely he&rsquo;s too smart,&rdquo; her father
      allowed. &ldquo;But what did they want you to do about it?&mdash;that&rsquo;s what <i>I</i>
      want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wanted me to say I knew nothing about it&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t and you don&rsquo;t&mdash;if you haven&rsquo;t even read it!&rdquo; Delia
      almost yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where IS the d&mdash;-d thing?&rdquo; their companion asked, looking helplessly
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the boulevard, at the very first of those kiosks you come to. That old
      woman has it&mdash;the one who speaks English&mdash;she always has it. Do
      go and get it&mdash;DO!&rdquo; And Delia pushed him, looked for his hat for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew he wanted to print something and I can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Francie
      said. &ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d crack up my portrait and that Mr. Waterlow would
      like that, and Gaston and every one. And he talked to me about the paper&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      always doing that and always was&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t see the harm. But even
      just knowing him&mdash;they think that&rsquo;s vile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should hope we can know whom we like!&rdquo;&mdash;and Delia bounced
      fairly round as from the force of her high spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dosson had put on his hat&mdash;he was going out for the paper. &ldquo;Why
      he kept us alive last year,&rdquo; he uttered in tribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he seems to have killed us now,&rdquo; Delia cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t give up an old friend,&rdquo; her father urged with his hand on the
      door. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t back down on anything you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, what a fuss about an old newspaper!&rdquo; Delia went on in her
      exasperation. &ldquo;It must be about two weeks old anyway. Didn&rsquo;t they ever see
      a society-paper before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t have seen much,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson. He paused still with his
      hand on the door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry&mdash;Gaston will make it all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gaston?&mdash;it will kill Gaston!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what they say?&rdquo; Delia demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gaston will never look at me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then he&rsquo;ll have to look at ME,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that he&rsquo;ll give you up&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be so CRAWLING?&rdquo; Delia
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say he&rsquo;s just the one who&rsquo;ll feel it most. But I&rsquo;m the one who does
      that,&rdquo; said Francie with a strange smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re stuffing you with lies&mdash;because THEY don&rsquo;t like it. He&rsquo;ll be
      tender and true,&rdquo; Delia glared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When THEY hate me?&mdash;Never!&rdquo; And Francie shook her head slowly, still
      with her smile of softness. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he cared for most&mdash;to make
      them like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t he a gentleman, I should like to know?&rdquo; asked Delia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s why I won&rsquo;t marry him&mdash;if I&rsquo;ve injured him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! he has seen the papers over there. You wait till he comes,&rdquo; Mr.
      Dosson enjoined, passing out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls remained there together and after a moment Delia resumed. &ldquo;Well,
      he has got to fix it&mdash;that&rsquo;s one thing I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has got to fix it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that villainous man. He has got to publish another piece saying it&rsquo;s
      all false or all a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;d better make him,&rdquo; said Francie with a weak laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
      better go after him&mdash;down to Nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say he&rsquo;s gone down to Nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say he was going there as soon as he came back from London&mdash;going
      right through without stopping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but he did,&rdquo; said Delia. Then she added: &ldquo;The mean coward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that? He can&rsquo;t hide at Nice&mdash;they can find him
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they going after him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want to shoot him&mdash;to stab him, I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;those
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wish they would,&rdquo; said Delia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;d better shoot me. I shall defend him. I shall protect him,&rdquo; Francie
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you protect him? You shall never speak to him again!&rdquo; her sister
      engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie had a pause. &ldquo;I can protect him without speaking to him. I can
      tell the simple truth&mdash;that he didn&rsquo;t print a word but what I told
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him not!&rdquo; Delia fairly hooted. &ldquo;When did he grow so
      particular? He fixed it up,&rdquo; she said with assurance. &ldquo;They always do in
      the papers&mdash;they&rsquo;d be ashamed if they didn&rsquo;t. Well now he has got to
      bring out a piece praising them up&mdash;praising them to the skies:
      that&rsquo;s what he has got to do!&rdquo; she wound up with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praising them up? They&rsquo;ll hate that worse,&rdquo; Francie returned musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia stared. &ldquo;What on earth then do they want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie had sunk to the sofa; her eyes were fixed on the carpet. She gave
      no reply to this question but presently said: &ldquo;We had better go to-morrow,
      the first hour that&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go where? Do you mean to Nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care where. Anywhere to get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before Gaston comes&mdash;without seeing him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see him. When they were all ranting and raving at me just
      now I wished he was there&mdash;I told them so. But now I don&rsquo;t feel like
      that&mdash;I can never see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose YOU&rsquo;RE crazy, are you?&rdquo; Delia returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell him it wasn&rsquo;t me&mdash;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; her companion went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia planted herself in front of her. &ldquo;Francie Dosson, if you&rsquo;re going to
      tell him you&rsquo;ve done anything wrong you might as well stop before you
      begin. Didn&rsquo;t you hear how poppa put it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Francie said listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t give up an old friend&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing on earth so mean.&rsquo; Now
      isn&rsquo;t Gaston Probert an old friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be very simple&mdash;he&rsquo;ll give me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll be worse than a worm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least&mdash;he&rsquo;ll give me up as he took me. He&rsquo;d never have
      asked me to marry him if he hadn&rsquo;t been able to get THEM to accept me: he
      thinks everything in life of THEM. If they cast me off now he&rsquo;ll do just
      the same. He&rsquo;ll have to choose between us, and when it comes to that he&rsquo;ll
      never choose me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never choose Mr. Flack, if that&rsquo;s what you mean&mdash;if you&rsquo;re
      going to identify yourself so with HIM!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I wish he&rsquo;d never been born!&rdquo; Francie wailed; after which she suddenly
      shivered. And then she added that she was sick&mdash;she was going to bed,
      and her sister took her off to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dosson that afternoon, sitting by his younger daughter&rsquo;s bedside, read
      the dreadful &ldquo;piece&rdquo; out to both his children from the copy of the
      Reverberator he had secured on the boulevard. It is a remarkable fact that
      as a family they were rather disappointed in this composition, in which
      their curiosity found less to repay it than it had expected, their
      resentment against Mr. Flack less to stimulate it, their fluttering effort
      to take the point of view of the Proberts less to sustain it, and their
      acceptance of the promulgation of Francie&rsquo;s innocent remarks as a natural
      incident of the life of the day less to make them reconsider it. The
      letter from Paris appeared lively, &ldquo;chatty,&rdquo; highly calculated to please,
      and so far as the personalities contained in it were concerned Mr. Dosson
      wanted to know if they weren&rsquo;t aware over here of the charges brought
      every day against the most prominent men in Boston. &ldquo;If there was anything
      in that style they might talk,&rdquo; he said; and he scanned the effusion
      afresh with a certain surprise at not finding in it some imputation of
      pecuniary malversation. The effect of an acquaintance with the text was to
      depress Delia, who didn&rsquo;t exactly see what there was in it to take back or
      explain away. However, she was aware there were some points they didn&rsquo;t
      understand, and doubtless these were the scandalous places&mdash;the
      things that had so worked up the Proberts. But why should they have minded
      if other people didn&rsquo;t understand the allusions (these were peculiar, but
      peculiarly incomprehensible) any better than she did? The whole thing
      struck Francie herself as infinitely less lurid than Mme. de Brecourt&rsquo;s
      account of it, and the part about her own situation and her beautiful
      picture seemed to make even less of the subject than it easily might have
      done. It was scanty, it was &ldquo;skimpy,&rdquo; and if Mr. Waterlow was offended it
      wouldn&rsquo;t be because they had published too much about him. It was
      nevertheless clear to her that there were a lot of things SHE hadn&rsquo;t told
      Mr. Flack, as well as a great many she had: perhaps those were the things
      that lady had put in&mdash;Florine or Dorine&mdash;the one she had
      mentioned at Mme. de Brecourt&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same, if the communication in the Reverberator let them down, at
      the hotel, more gently than had seemed likely and bristled so much less
      than was to have been feared with explanations of the anguish of the
      Proberts, this didn&rsquo;t diminish the girl&rsquo;s sense of responsibility nor make
      the case a whit less grave. It only showed how sensitive and fastidious
      the Proberts were and therefore with what difficulty they would come round
      to condonation. Moreover Francie made another reflexion as she lay there&mdash;for
      Delia kept her in bed nearly three days, feeling this to be for the moment
      at any rate an effectual reply to any absurd heroics about leaving Paris.
      Perhaps they had got &ldquo;case-hardened&rdquo; Francie said to herself; perhaps they
      had read so many such bad things that they had lost the delicacy of their
      palate, as people were said to do who lived on food too violently spiced.
      Then, very weak and vague and passive as she was now, in the bedimmed
      room, in the soft Parisian bed and with Delia treating her as much as
      possible like a sick person, she thought of the lively and chatty letters
      they had always seen in the papers and wondered if they ALL meant a
      violation of sanctities, a convulsion of homes, a burning of smitten
      faces, a rupture of girls&rsquo; engagements. It was present to her as an
      agreeable negative, I must add, that her father and sister took no
      strenuous view of her responsibility or of their own: they neither brought
      the matter home to her as a crime nor made her worse through her feeling
      them anxiously understate their blame. There was a pleasant cheerful
      helplessness in her father on this head as on every other. There could be
      no more discussion among them on such a question than there had ever been,
      for none was needed to show that for these candid minds the newspapers and
      all they contained were a part of the general fatality of things, of the
      recurrent freshness of the universe, coming out like the sun in the
      morning or the stars at night or the wind and the weather at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing that worried Francie most while Delia kept her in bed was the
      apprehension of what her father might do; but this was not a fear of what
      he might do to Mr. Flack. He would go round perhaps to Mr. Probert&rsquo;s or to
      Mme. de Brecourt&rsquo;s and reprimand them for having made things so rough to
      his &ldquo;chicken.&rdquo; It was true she had scarcely ever seen him reprimand any
      one for anything; but on the other hand nothing like this had ever
      happened before to her or to Delia. They had made each other cry once or
      twice, but no one else had ever made them, and no one had ever broken out
      on them that way and frightened them half to death. Francie wanted her
      father not to go round; she had a sense that those other people had
      somehow stores of comparison, of propriety, of superiority, in any
      discussion, which he couldn&rsquo;t command. She wanted nothing done and no
      communication to pass&mdash;only a proud unbickering silence on the part
      of the Dossons. If the Proberts made a noise and they made none it would
      be they who would have the best appearance. Moreover now, with each
      elapsing day, she felt she did wish to see Gaston about it. Her desire was
      to wait, counting the hours, so that she might just clearly explain,
      saying two or three things. Perhaps these things wouldn&rsquo;t make it better&mdash;very
      likely they wouldn&rsquo;t; but at any rate nothing would have been done in the
      interval, at least on her part and her father&rsquo;s and Delia&rsquo;s, to make it
      worse. She told her father that she wouldn&rsquo;t, as Delia put it, &ldquo;want to
      have him&rdquo; go round, and was in some degree relieved at perceiving that he
      didn&rsquo;t seem very clear as to what it was open to him to say to their
      alienated friends. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid but was uncertain. His relation to
      almost everything that had happened to them as a family from a good while
      back was a sense of the absence of precedents, and precedents were
      particularly absent now, for he had never before seen a lot of people in a
      rage about a piece in the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delia also reassured her; she said she&rsquo;d see to it that poppa didn&rsquo;t sneak
      round. She communicated to her indeed that he hadn&rsquo;t the smallest doubt
      that Gaston, in a few days, would blow them up&mdash;all THEM down there&mdash;much
      higher than they had blown her, and that he was very sorry he had let her
      go down herself on that sort of summons. It was for her and the rest to
      come to Francie and to him, and if they had anything practical to say
      they&rsquo;d arrive in a body yet. If Mr. Dosson had the sense of his daughter&rsquo;s
      having been roughly handled he derived some of the consolation of
      amusement from his persistent humorous view of the Proberts as a &ldquo;body.&rdquo;
       If they were consistent with their character or with their complaint they
      would move en masse upon the hotel, and he hung about at home a good deal
      as if to wait for them. Delia intimated to her sister that this vision
      cheered them up as they sat, they two, in the red salon while Francie was
      in bed. Of course it didn&rsquo;t exhilarate this young lady, and she even
      looked for no brighter side now. She knew almost nothing but her sharp
      little ache of suspense, her presentiment of Gaston&rsquo;s horror, which grew
      all the while. Delia remarked to her once that he would have seen lots of
      society-papers over there, he would have become familiar; but this only
      suggested to the girl&mdash;she had at present strange new moments and
      impulses of quick reasoning&mdash;that they would only prepare him to be
      disgusted, not to be indifferent. His disgust would be colder than
      anything she had ever known and would complete her knowledge of him&mdash;make
      her understand him properly for the first time. She would just meet it as
      briefly as possible; it would wind up the business, close the incident,
      and all would be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t write; that proved it in advance; there had now been two or
      three mails without a letter. He had seen the paper in Boston or in New
      York and it had simply struck him dumb. It was very well for Delia to say
      that of course he didn&rsquo;t write when he was on the ocean: how could they
      get his letters even if he did? There had been time before&mdash;before he
      sailed; though Delia represented that people never wrote then. They were
      ever so much too busy at the last and were going to see their
      correspondents in a few days anyway. The only missives that came to
      Francie were a copy of the Reverberator, addressed in Mr. Flack&rsquo;s hand and
      with a great inkmark on the margin of the fatal letter, and three intense
      pages from Mme. de Brecourt, received forty-eight hours after the scene at
      her house. This lady expressed herself as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR FRANCIE&mdash;I felt very badly after you had gone yesterday
      morning, and I had twenty minds to go and see you. But we&rsquo;ve talked it
      over conscientiously and it appears to us that we&rsquo;ve no right to take any
      such step till Gaston arrives. The situation isn&rsquo;t exclusively ours but
      belongs to him as well, and we feel we ought to make it over to him in as
      simple and compact a form as possible. Therefore, as we regard it, we had
      better not touch it (it&rsquo;s so delicate, isn&rsquo;t it, my poor child?) but leave
      it just as it is. They think I even exceed my powers in writing you these
      simple lines, and that once your participation has been constatee (which
      was the only advantage of that dreadful scene) EVERYTHING should stop. But
      I&rsquo;ve liked you, Francie, I&rsquo;ve believed in you, and I don&rsquo;t wish you to be
      able to say that in spite of the thunderbolt you&rsquo;ve drawn down on us I&rsquo;ve
      not treated you with tenderness. It&rsquo;s a thunderbolt indeed, my poor and
      innocent but disastrous little friend! We&rsquo;re hearing more of it already&mdash;the
      horrible Republican papers here have (AS WE KNOW) already got hold of the
      unspeakable sheet and are preparing to reproduce the article: that is such
      parts of it as they may put forward (with innuendoes and sous-entendus to
      eke out the rest) without exposing themselves to a suit for defamation.
      Poor Leonie de Villepreux has been with us constantly and Jeanne and her
      husband have telegraphed that we may expect them day after to-morrow. They
      are evidently immensely emotionnes, for they almost never telegraph. They
      wish so to receive Gaston. We have determined all the same to be intensely
      QUIET, and that will be sure to be his view. Alphonse and Maxime now
      recognise that it&rsquo;s best to leave Mr. Flack alone, hard as it is to keep
      one&rsquo;s hands off him. Have you anything to lui faire dire&mdash;to my
      precious brother when he arrives? But it&rsquo;s foolish of me to ask you that,
      for you had much better not answer this. You will no doubt have an
      opportunity to say to him&mdash;whatever, my dear Francie, you CAN say! It
      will matter comparatively little that you may never be able to say it to
      your friend with every allowance SUZANNE DE BRECOURT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie looked at this letter and tossed it away without reading it. Delia
      picked it up, read it to her father, who didn&rsquo;t understand it, and kept it
      in her possession, poring over it as Mr. Flack had seen her pore over the
      cards that were left while she was out or over the registers of American
      travellers. They knew of Gaston&rsquo;s arrival by his telegraphing from Havre
      (he came back by the French line) and he mentioned the hour&mdash;&ldquo;about
      dinner-time&rdquo;&mdash;at which he should reach Paris. Delia, after dinner,
      made her father take her to the circus so that Francie should be left
      alone to receive her intended, who would be sure to hurry round in the
      course of the evening. The girl herself expressed no preference whatever
      on this point, and the idea was one of Delia&rsquo;s masterly ones, her flashes
      of inspiration. There was never any difficulty about imposing such
      conceptions on poppa. But at half-past ten, when they returned, the young
      man had not appeared, and Francie remained only long enough to say &ldquo;I told
      you so!&rdquo; with a white face and march off to her room with her candle. She
      locked herself in and her sister couldn&rsquo;t get at her that night. It was
      another of Delia&rsquo;s inspirations not to try, after she had felt that the
      door was fast. She forbore, in the exercise of a great discretion, but she
      herself for the ensuing hours slept no wink. Nevertheless the next
      morning, as early as ten o&rsquo;clock, she had the energy to drag her father
      out to the banker&rsquo;s and to keep him out two hours. It would be
      inconceivable now that Gaston shouldn&rsquo;t turn up before dejeuner. He did
      turn up; about eleven o&rsquo;clock he came in and found Francie alone. She
      noticed, for strangeness, that he was very pale at the same time that he
      was sunburnt; also that he didn&rsquo;t for an instant smile at her. It was very
      certain there was no bright flicker in her own face, and they had the most
      singular, the most unnatural meeting. He only said as he arrived: &ldquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t come last evening; they made it impossible; they were all there
      and we were up till three o&rsquo;clock this morning.&rdquo; He looked as if he had
      been through terrible things, and it wasn&rsquo;t simply the strain of his
      attention to so much business in America. What passed next she couldn&rsquo;t
      remember afterwards; it seemed but a few seconds before he said to her
      slowly, holding her hand&mdash;before this he had pressed his lips to hers
      silently&mdash;&ldquo;Is it true, Francie, what they say (and they swear to it!)
      that YOU told that blackguard those horrors; that that infamous letter&rsquo;s
      only a report of YOUR talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him everything&mdash;it&rsquo;s all me, ME, ME!&rdquo; the girl replied
      exaltedly, without pretending to hesitate an instant as to what he might
      mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaston looked at her with deep eyes, then walked straight away to the
      window and remained there in silence. She herself said nothing more. At
      last the young man went on: &ldquo;And I who insisted to them that there was no
      natural delicacy like yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll never need to insist about anything any more!&rdquo; she cried.
      And with this she dashed out of the room by the nearest door. When Delia
      and Mr. Dosson returned the red salon was empty and Francie was again
      locked in her room. But this time her sister forced an entrance.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Dosson, as we know, was, almost more than anything else, loosely
      contemplative, and the present occasion could only minister to that side
      of his nature, especially as, so far at least as his observation of his
      daughters went, it had not urged him into uncontrollable movement. But the
      truth is that the intensity, or rather the continuity, of his meditations
      did engender an act not perceived by these young ladies, though its
      consequences presently became definite enough. While he waited for the
      Proberts to arrive in a phalanx and noted that they failed to do so he had
      plenty of time to ask himself&mdash;and also to ask Delia&mdash;questions
      about Mr. Flack. So far as they were addressed to his daughter they were
      promptly answered, for Delia had been ready from the first, as we have
      seen, to pronounce upon the conduct of the young journalist. Her view of
      it was clearer every hour; there was a difference however in the course of
      action which she judged this view to demand. At first he was to have been
      blown up sky-high for the mess he had got them into&mdash;profitless as
      the process might be and vain the satisfaction; he was to have been
      scourged with the sharpest lashes the sense of violated confidence could
      inflict. At present he was not to be touched with a ten-foot pole, but
      rather cut dead, cast off and ignored, let alone to his dying day: Delia
      quickly caught at this for the right grand way of showing displeasure.
      Such was the manner in which she characterised it in her frequent
      conversations with her father, if that can be called conversation which
      consisted of his serenely smoking while she poured forth arguments that
      kept repetition abreast of variety. The same cause will according to
      application produce effects without sameness: as a mark of which truth the
      catastrophe that made Delia express freely the hope she might never again
      see so much as the end of Mr. Flack&rsquo;s nose had just the opposite action on
      her parent. The best balm for his mystification would have been to let his
      eyes sociably travel over his young friend&rsquo;s whole person; this would have
      been to deal again with quantities and forces he could measure and in
      terms he could understand. If indeed the difference had been pushed
      further the girl would have kept the field, for she had the advantage of
      being able to motive her attitude, to which Mr. Dosson could have opposed
      but an indefensible, in fact an inarticulate, laxity. She had touched on
      her deepest conviction in saying to Francie that the correspondent of the
      Reverberator had played them that trick on purpose to get them into such
      trouble with the Proberts that he might see his own hopes bloom again in
      the heat of their disaster. This had many of the appearances of a strained
      interpretation, but that didn&rsquo;t prevent Delia from placing it before her
      father several times an hour. It mattered little that he should remark in
      return that he didn&rsquo;t see what good it could do Mr. Flack that Francie&mdash;and
      he and Delia, for all he could guess&mdash;should be disgusted with him:
      to Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s mind that was such a queer way of reasoning. Delia
      maintained that she understood perfectly, though she couldn&rsquo;t explain&mdash;and
      at any rate she didn&rsquo;t want the manoeuvring creature to come flying back
      from Nice. She didn&rsquo;t want him to know there had been a scandal, that they
      had a grievance against him, that any one had so much as heard of his
      article or cared what he published or didn&rsquo;t publish; above all she didn&rsquo;t
      want him to know that the Proberts had cooled off. She didn&rsquo;t want him to
      dream he could have had such effects. Mixed up with this high rigour on
      Miss Dosson&rsquo;s part was the oddest secret complacency of reflexion that in
      consequence of what Mr. Flack HAD published the great American community
      was in a position to know with what fine folks Francie and she were
      associated. She hoped that some of the people who used only to call when
      they were &ldquo;off to-morrow&rdquo; would take the lesson to heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she glowed with this consolation as well as with the resentment for
      which it was required her father quietly addressed a few words by letter
      to their young friend in the south. This communication was not of a
      minatory order; it expressed on the contrary the loose sociability which
      was the essence of the good gentleman&rsquo;s nature. He wanted to see Mr.
      Flack, to talk the whole thing over, and the desire to hold him to an
      account would play but a small part in the interview. It commended itself
      much more to him that the touchiness of the Proberts should be a sign of a
      family of cranks&mdash;so little did any experience of his own match it&mdash;than
      that a newspaper-man had misbehaved in trying to turn out an attractive
      piece. As the newspaper-man happened to be the person with whom he had
      most consorted for some time back he felt drawn to him in presence of a
      new problem, and somehow it didn&rsquo;t seem to Mr. Dosson to disqualify him as
      a source of comfort that it was just he who had been the fountain of
      injury. The injury wouldn&rsquo;t be there if the Proberts didn&rsquo;t point to it
      with a thousand ringers. Moreover Mr. Dosson couldn&rsquo;t turn his back at
      such short notice on a man who had smoked so many of his cigars, ordered
      so many of his dinners and helped him so handsomely to spend his money:
      such acts constituted a bond, and when there was a bond people gave it a
      little jerk in time of trouble. His letter to Nice was the little jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after Francie had passed with such an air from Gaston&rsquo;s sight
      and left him planted in the salon&mdash;he had remained ten minutes, to
      see if she would reappear, and then had marched out of the hotel&mdash;she
      received by the first post a letter from him, written the evening before.
      It conveyed his deep regret that their meeting that day should have been
      of so painful, so unnatural a character, and the hope that she didn&rsquo;t
      consider, as her strange behaviour had seemed to suggest, that SHE had
      anything to complain of. There was too much he wanted to say, and above
      all too much he wanted to ask, for him to consent to the indefinite
      postponement of a necessary interview. There were explanations,
      assurances, de part et d&rsquo;autre, with which it was manifestly impossible
      that either of them should dispense. He would therefore propose that she
      should see him again, and not be wanting in patience to that end, late on
      the morrow. He didn&rsquo;t propose an earlier moment because his hands were
      terribly full at home. Frankly speaking, the state of things there was of
      the worst. Jane and her husband had just arrived and had made him a
      violent, an unexpected scene. Two of the French newspapers had got hold of
      the article and had given the most perfidious extracts. His father hadn&rsquo;t
      stirred out of the house, hadn&rsquo;t put his foot inside a club, for more than
      a week. Marguerite and Maxime were immediately to start for England on an
      indefinite absence. They couldn&rsquo;t face their life in Paris. For himself he
      was in the breach, fighting hard and making, on her behalf, asseverations
      it was impossible for him to believe, in spite of the dreadful defiant
      confession she had appeared to throw at him in the morning, that she
      wouldn&rsquo;t virtually confirm. He would come in as soon after nine as
      possible; the day up to that time would be stiff in the Cours la Reine,
      and he begged her in the meantime not to doubt of his perfect tenderness.
      So far from her having caused it at all to shrink, he had never yet felt
      her to have, in his affection, such a treasure of indulgence to draw upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of hours after the receipt of this manifesto Francie lay on one
      of the satin sofas with her eyes closed and her hand clinched upon it in
      her pocket. Delia sat hard by with a needle in her fingers, certain
      morsels of silk and ribbon in her lap, several pins in her mouth, and her
      attention turning constantly from her work to her sister&rsquo;s face. The
      weather was now so completely vernal that Mr. Dosson was able to haunt the
      court, and he had lately resumed this practice, in which he was presumably
      at the present moment absorbed. Delia had lowered her needle and was
      making sure if her companion were awake&mdash;she had been perfectly still
      for so long&mdash;when her glance was drawn to the door, which she heard
      pushed open. Mr. Flack stood there, looking from one to the other of the
      young ladies as to see which would be most agreeably surprised by his
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw your father downstairs&mdash;he says it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the
      journalist, advancing with a brave grin. &ldquo;He told me to come straight up&mdash;I
      had quite a talk with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;ALL RIGHT?&rdquo; Delia Dosson repeated, springing up. &ldquo;Yes
      indeed&mdash;I should say so!&rdquo; Then she checked herself, asking in another
      manner: &ldquo;Is that so? poppa sent you up?&rdquo; And then in still another: &ldquo;Well,
      have you had a good time at Nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better all come right down and see. It&rsquo;s lovely down there. If
      you&rsquo;ll come down I&rsquo;ll go right back. I guess you want a change,&rdquo; Mr. Flack
      went on. He spoke to Delia but he looked at Francie, who showed she had
      not been asleep by the quick consciousness with which she raised herself
      on her sofa. She gazed at the visitor with parted lips, but uttered no
      word. He barely faltered, coming toward her with his conscious grimace and
      his hand out. His knowing eyes were more knowing than ever, but had an odd
      appearance of being smaller, like penetrating points. &ldquo;Your father has
      told me all about it. Did you ever hear of anything so cheap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All about what?&mdash;all about what?&rdquo; said Delia, whose attempt to
      represent happy ignorance was menaced by an intromission of ferocity. She
      might succeed in appearing ignorant, but could scarcely succeed in
      appearing kind. Francie had risen to her feet and had suffered Mr. Flack
      to possess himself for a moment of her hand, but neither of them had asked
      the young man to sit down. &ldquo;I thought you were going to stay a month at
      Nice?&rdquo; Delia continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was, but your father&rsquo;s letter started me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wrote me about the row&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you know it? Then I broke. You
      didn&rsquo;t suppose I was going to stay down there when there were such times
      up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; Delia panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it pleasant at Nice? Is it very gay? Isn&rsquo;t it very hot now?&rdquo; Francie
      rather limply asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s all right. But I haven&rsquo;t come up here to crow about Nice, have
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, if we want you to?&rdquo;&mdash;Delia spoke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flack looked at her for a moment very hard, in the whites of the eyes;
      then he replied, turning back to her sister: &ldquo;Anything YOU like, Miss
      Francie. With you one subject&rsquo;s as good as another. Can&rsquo;t we sit down?
      Can&rsquo;t we be comfortable?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comfortable? of course we can!&rdquo; cried Delia, but she remained erect while
      Francie sank upon the sofa again and their companion took possession of
      the nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember what I told you once, that the people WILL have the
      plums?&rdquo; George Flack asked with a hard buoyancy of the younger girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked an instant as if she were trying to recollect what he had told
      her; and then said, more remotely, &ldquo;DID father write to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he did. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor father, sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t know WHAT to do!&rdquo; Delia threw in with
      violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me the Reverberator has raised a breeze. I guessed that for
      myself when I saw the way the papers here were after it. That thing will
      go the rounds, you&rsquo;ll see. What brought me was learning from him that they
      HAVE got their backs up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth are you talking about?&rdquo; Delia Dosson rang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flack turned his eyes on her own as he had done a moment before;
      Francie sat there serious, looking hard at the carpet. &ldquo;What game are you
      trying, Miss Delia? It ain&rsquo;t true YOU care what I wrote, is it?&rdquo; he
      pursued, addressing himself again to Francie.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment she raised her eyes. &ldquo;Did you write it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you care what he wrote&mdash;or what does any one care?&rdquo; Delia
      again interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has done the paper more good than anything&mdash;every one&rsquo;s so
      interested,&rdquo; said Mr. Flack in the tone of reasonable explanation. &ldquo;And
      you don&rsquo;t feel you&rsquo;ve anything to complain of, do you?&rdquo; he added to
      Francie kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean because I told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why certainly. Didn&rsquo;t it all spring out of that lovely drive and that
      walk up in the Bois we had&mdash;when you took me up to see your portrait?
      Didn&rsquo;t you understand that I wanted you to know that the public would
      appreciate a column or two about Mr. Waterlow&rsquo;s new picture, and about you
      as the subject of it, and about your being engaged to a member of the
      grand old monde, and about what was going on in the grand old monde, which
      would naturally attract attention through that? Why Miss Francie,&rdquo; Mr.
      Flack ever so blandly pursued, &ldquo;you regularly TALKED as if you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I talk a great deal?&rdquo; asked Francie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why most freely&mdash;it was too lovely. We had a real grand old jaw.
      Don&rsquo;t you remember when we sat there in the Bois?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh rubbish!&rdquo; Delia panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and Mme. de Cliche passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you told me she was scandalised. And we had to laugh,&rdquo; he reminded
      her&mdash;&ldquo;it struck us as so idiotic. I said it was a high old POSE, and
      I knew what to think of it. Your father tells me she&rsquo;s scandalised now&mdash;she
      and all the rest of them&mdash;at the sight of their names at last in a
      REAL newspaper. Well now, if you want to know, it&rsquo;s a bigger pose than
      ever, and, as I said just now, it&rsquo;s too damned cheap. It&rsquo;s THIN&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what it is; and if it were genuine it wouldn&rsquo;t count. They pretend to be
      shocked because it looks exclusive, but in point of fact they like it
      first-rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you talking about that old piece in the paper? Mercy, wasn&rsquo;t that
      dead and buried days and days ago?&rdquo; Delia quavered afresh. She hovered
      there in dismay as well as in displeasure, upset by the news that her
      father had summoned Mr. Flack to Paris, which struck her almost as a
      treachery, since it seemed to denote a plan. A plan, and an uncommunicated
      plan, on Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s part was unnatural and alarming; and there was
      further provocation in his appearing to shirk the responsibility of it by
      not having come up at such a moment with his accomplice. Delia was
      impatient to know what he wanted anyway. Did he want to drag them down
      again to such commonness&mdash;ah she felt the commonness now!&mdash;even
      though it COULD hustle? Did he want to put Mr. Flack forward, with a
      feeble flourish that didn&rsquo;t answer one of their questions, as a substitute
      for the alienated Gaston? If she hadn&rsquo;t been afraid that something still
      more uncanny than anything that had happened yet might come to pass
      between her two companions in case of her leaving them together she would
      have darted down to the court to appease her conjectures, to challenge her
      father and tell him how particularly pleased she should be if he wouldn&rsquo;t
      put in his oar. She felt liberated, however, the next moment, for
      something occurred that struck her as a sure proof of the state of her
      sister&rsquo;s spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the view I take of the matter, according to what your father
      has told me?&rdquo; Mr. Flack enquired. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it was he gave me the tip;
      I guess I&rsquo;ve seen enough over here by this time to have worked it out.
      They&rsquo;re scandalised all right&mdash;they&rsquo;re blue with horror and have
      never heard of anything so dreadful. Miss Francie,&rdquo; her visitor roared,
      &ldquo;that ain&rsquo;t good enough for you and me. They know what&rsquo;s in the papers
      every day of their lives and they know how it got there. They ain&rsquo;t like
      the fellow in the story&mdash;who was he?&mdash;who couldn&rsquo;t think how the
      apples got into the dumplings. They&rsquo;re just grabbing a pretext to break
      because&mdash;because, well, they don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re blue blood. They&rsquo;re
      delighted to strike a pretext they can work, and they&rsquo;re all cackling over
      the egg it has taken so many hens of &lsquo;em to lay. That&rsquo;s MY diagnosis if
      you want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;how can you say such a thing?&rdquo; Francie returned with a tremor in
      her voice that struck her sister. Her eyes met Delia&rsquo;s at the same moment,
      and this young woman&rsquo;s heart bounded with the sense that she was safe. Mr.
      Flack&rsquo;s power to hustle presumed too far&mdash;though Mr. Dosson had crude
      notions about the licence of the press she felt, even as an untutored
      woman, what a false step he was now taking&mdash;and it seemed to her that
      Francie, who was not impressed (the particular light in her eyes now
      showed it) could be trusted to allow him no benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter what he says, my dear?&rdquo; she interposed. &ldquo;Do make him
      drop the subject&mdash;he&rsquo;s talking very wild. I&rsquo;m going down to see what
      poppa means&mdash;I never heard of anything so flat!&rdquo; At the door she
      paused a moment to add mutely, by mere facial force: &ldquo;Now just wipe him
      out, mind!&rdquo; It was the same injunction she had launched at her from afar
      that day, a year before, when they all dined at Saint-Germain, and she
      could remember how effective it had then been. The next moment she flirted
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she had gone Mr. Flack moved nearer to Francie. &ldquo;Now look here,
      you&rsquo;re not going back on me, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going back on you&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we together in this thing? WHY sure! We&rsquo;re CLOSE together, Miss
      Francie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Together&mdash;together?&rdquo; Francie repeated with charming wan but not at
      all tender eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember what I said to you&mdash;just as straight as my course
      always is&mdash;before we went up there, before our lovely drive? I stated
      to you that I felt&mdash;that I always feel&mdash;my great hearty hungry
      public behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I understood&mdash;it was all for you to work it up. I told them
      so. I never denied it,&rdquo; Francie brought forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told them so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they were all crying and going on. I told them I knew it&mdash;I
      told them I gave you the tip as you call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt Mr. Flack fix her all alarmingly as she spoke these words; then
      he was still nearer to her&mdash;he had taken her hand. &ldquo;Ah you&rsquo;re too
      sweet!&rdquo; She disengaged her hand and in the effort she sprang up; but he,
      rising too, seemed to press always nearer&mdash;she had a sense (it was
      disagreeable) that he was demonstrative&mdash;so that she retreated a
      little before him. &ldquo;They were all there roaring and raging, trying to make
      you believe you had outraged them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All but young Mr. Probert. Certainly they don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she said at her
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cowards!&rdquo; George Flack after a moment remarked. &ldquo;And where was young
      Mr. Probert?&rdquo; he then demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was away&mdash;I&rsquo;ve told you&mdash;in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, your father told me. But now he&rsquo;s back doesn&rsquo;t he like it
      either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Flack,&rdquo; Francie answered with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I do then. He&rsquo;s a coward too&mdash;he&rsquo;ll do what his poppa tells
      him, and the countess and the duchess and his French brothers-in-law from
      whom he takes lessons: he&rsquo;ll just back down, he&rsquo;ll give you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk with you about that,&rdquo; said Francie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? why is he such a sacred subject, when we ARE together? You can&rsquo;t
      alter that,&rdquo; her visitor insisted. &ldquo;It was too lovely your standing up for
      me&mdash;your not denying me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put in things I never said. It seems to me it was very different,&rdquo;
       she freely contended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything IS different when it&rsquo;s printed. What else would be the good of
      the papers? Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t I; it was a lady who helps me here&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      heard me speak of her: Miss Topping. She wants so much to know you&mdash;she
      wants to talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will she publish THAT?&rdquo; Francie asked with unstudied effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flack stared a moment. &ldquo;Lord, how they&rsquo;ve worked on you! And do YOU
      think it&rsquo;s bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I think what&rsquo;s bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the letter we&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t see the point of so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited a little, interestedly. &ldquo;Do you think I took any advantage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer at first, but after a moment said in a tone he had
      never heard from her: &ldquo;Why do you come here this way? Why do you ask me
      such questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated; after which he broke out: &ldquo;Because I love you. Don&rsquo;t you
      know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh PLEASE don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she almost moaned, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was launched now and he let himself go. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you understand
      it&mdash;why won&rsquo;t you understand the rest? Don&rsquo;t you see how it has
      worked round&mdash;the heartless brutes they&rsquo;ve turned into, and the way
      OUR life, yours and mine, is bound to be the same? Don&rsquo;t you see the
      damned sneaking scorn with which they treat you and that <i>I</i> only
      want to do anything in the world for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie&rsquo;s white face, very quiet now, let all this pass without a sign of
      satisfaction. Her only response was presently to say: &ldquo;Why did you ask me
      so many questions that day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I always ask questions&mdash;it&rsquo;s my nature and my business to
      ask them. Haven&rsquo;t you always seen me ask you and ask every one all I
      could? Don&rsquo;t you know they&rsquo;re the very foundation of my work? I thought
      you sympathised with my work so much&mdash;you used to tell me you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did,&rdquo; she allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put it in the dead past, I see. You don&rsquo;t then any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If this remark was on her visitor&rsquo;s part the sign of a rare assurance the
      girl&rsquo;s cold mildness was still unruffled by it. She considered, she even
      smiled; then she replied: &ldquo;Oh yes I do&mdash;only not so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They HAVE worked on you; but I should have thought they&rsquo;d have disgusted
      you. I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;even a little sympathy will do: whatever you&rsquo;ve
      got left.&rdquo; He paused, looking at her, but it was a speech she had nothing
      for; so he went on: &ldquo;There was no obligation for you to answer my
      questions&mdash;you might have shut me up that day with a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she asked with all her grave good faith in her face. &ldquo;I thought
      I HAD to&mdash;for fear I should appear ungrateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungrateful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why to you&mdash;after what you had done. Don&rsquo;t you remember that it was
      you who introduced us&mdash;?&rdquo; And she paused with a fatigued delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to those snobs who are screaming like frightened peacocks. I beg your
      pardon&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t THAT on my conscience!&rdquo; Mr. Flack quite grandly
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you introduced us to Mr. Waterlow and he introduced us to&mdash;to
      his friends,&rdquo; she explained, colouring, as if it were a fault for the
      inexactness caused by her magnanimity. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I thought I ought to
      tell you what you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you suppose if I&rsquo;d known where that first visit of ours to
      Waterlow was going to bring you out I&rsquo;d have taken you within fifty miles&mdash;?&rdquo;
       He stopped suddenly; then in another tone: &ldquo;Jerusalem, there&rsquo;s no one like
      you! And you told them it was all YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what I told them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Francie,&rdquo; said George Flack, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll marry me I&rsquo;ll never ask a
      question again. I&rsquo;ll go into some other business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose?&rdquo; Francie asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get me into a quarrel with them&mdash;so that I might be free again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all the blamed ideas&mdash;!&rdquo; the young man gasped. &ldquo;YOUR pure
      mind never gave birth to that&mdash;it was your sister&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it natural it should occur to me, since if, as you say, you&rsquo;d
      never consciously have been the means&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah but I WAS the means!&rdquo; Mr. Flack interrupted. &ldquo;We must go, after all,
      by what DID happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thanked you when I drove with you and let you draw me out. So
      we&rsquo;re square, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; The term Francie used was a colloquialism
      generally associated with levity, but her face, as she spoke, was none the
      less deeply serious&mdash;serious even to pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re square?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to ask for anything more. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye? Never!&rdquo; cried George Flack, who flushed with his defeat to a
      degree that spoke strangely of his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the way she repeated her &ldquo;Goodbye!&rdquo; betrayed her impression
      of this, and not a little withal that so much confidence left her
      unflattered. &ldquo;Do go away!&rdquo; she broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come back very soon&rdquo;&mdash;and he took up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; She had now contrived to put a wide
      space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you tormentress!&rdquo; he groaned. He went toward the door, but before he
      reached it turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me this anyway? ARE you going to marry the lot&mdash;after
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to put that in the paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do&mdash;and say you said it!&rdquo; Mr. Flack held up his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood looking at each other across the large room. &ldquo;Well then&mdash;I
      ain&rsquo;t. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said as he went out.

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Gaston Probert came that evening he was received by Dosson and Delia,
      and when he asked where Francie might be was told by the latter that she
      would show herself in half an hour. Francie had instructed her sister that
      as their friend would have, first of all, information to give their father
      about the business he had transacted in America he wouldn&rsquo;t care for a lot
      of women in the room. When Delia reported this speech to Mr. Dosson that
      gentleman protested that he wasn&rsquo;t in any hurry for the business; what he
      wanted to find out most was whether Mr. Probert had a good time&mdash;whether
      he had liked it over there. Gaston might have liked it, but he didn&rsquo;t look
      as if he had had a very good time. His face told of reverses, of
      suffering; and Delia declared to him that if she hadn&rsquo;t received his
      assurance to the contrary she would have believed he was right down sick.
      He allowed that he had been very sick at sea and was still feeling the
      effect of it, but insisted that there was nothing the matter with him now.
      He sat for some time with Mr. Dosson and Delia, and never once alluded to
      the cloud that hung over their relations. The girl had schooled her father
      to a waiting attitude on this point, and the manner in which she had
      descended on him in the morning, after Mr. Flack had come upstairs, was a
      lesson he wasn&rsquo;t likely soon to forget. It had been impressed on him that
      she was indeed wiser than he could pretend to be, and he was now mindful
      that he mustn&rsquo;t speak of the &ldquo;piece in the paper&rdquo; unless young Probert
      should speak of it first. When Delia rushed down to him in the court she
      began by asking him categorically whom he had wished to do good to by
      sending Mr. Flack up to their parlour. To Francie or to her? Why the way
      they felt then, they detested his very name. To Mr. Flack himself? Why he
      had simply exposed him to the biggest snub he had ever got in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hanged if I understand!&rdquo; poor Mr. Dosson had said. &ldquo;I thought you
      liked the piece&mdash;you think it&rsquo;s so queer THEY don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; &ldquo;They,&rdquo;
       in the parlance of the Dossons, now never meant anything but the Proberts
      in congress assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything&rsquo;s queer but you!&rdquo; Delia had retorted; and she had
      let her father know that she had left Francie in the very act of
      &ldquo;handling&rdquo; Mr. Flack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; the old gentleman had quavered in an impotence that made him
      wince with a sense of meanness&mdash;meanness to his bold initiator of so
      many Parisian hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie&rsquo;s visitor came down a few minutes later and passed through the
      court and out of the hotel without looking at them. Mr. Dosson had been
      going to call after him, but Delia checked him with a violent pinch. The
      unsociable manner of the young journalist&rsquo;s departure deepened Mr.
      Dosson&rsquo;s dull ache over the mystery of things. I think this may be said to
      have been the only incident in the whole business that gave him a personal
      pang. He remembered how many of his cigars he had smoked with Mr. Flack
      and how universal a participant he had made him. This haughtiness struck
      him as the failure of friendship&mdash;not the publication of details
      about the Proberts. Interwoven with Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s nature was the view that
      if these people had done bad things they ought to be ashamed of themselves
      and he couldn&rsquo;t pity them, and that if they hadn&rsquo;t done them there was no
      need of making such a rumpus about other people&rsquo;s knowing. It was
      therefore, in spite of the young man&rsquo;s rough exit, still in the tone of
      American condonation that he had observed to Delia: &ldquo;He says that&rsquo;s what
      they like over there and that it stands to reason that if you start a
      paper you&rsquo;ve got to give them what they like. If you want the people with
      you, you&rsquo;ve got to be with the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there are a good many people in the world. I don&rsquo;t think the
      Proberts are with us much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh he doesn&rsquo;t mean them,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do!&rdquo; cried Delia.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one of the ormolu tables, near a lamp with a pink shade, Gaston
      insisted on making at least a partial statement. He didn&rsquo;t say that he
      might never have another chance, but Delia felt with despair that this
      idea was in his mind. He was very gentle, very polite, but distinctly
      cold, she thought; he was intensely depressed and for half an hour uttered
      not the least little pleasantry. There was no particular occasion for that
      when he talked about &ldquo;preferred bonds&rdquo; with her father. This was a
      language Delia couldn&rsquo;t translate, though she had heard it from childhood.
      He had a great many papers to show Mr. Dosson, records of the mission of
      which he had acquitted himself, but Mr. Dosson pushed them into the drawer
      of the ormolu table with the remark that he guessed they were all right.
      Now, after the fact, he appeared to attach but little importance to
      Gaston&rsquo;s achievements&mdash;an attitude which Delia perceived to be
      slightly disconcerting to their visitor. Delia understood it: she had an
      instinctive sense that her father knew a great deal more than Gaston could
      tell him even about the work he had committed to him, and also that there
      was in such punctual settlements an eagerness, a literalism, totally
      foreign to Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s domestic habits and to which he would even have
      imputed a certain pettifogging provinciality&mdash;treatable however with
      dry humour. If Gaston had cooled off he wanted at least to be able to say
      that he had rendered them services in America; but now her father, for the
      moment at least, scarcely appeared to think his services worth speaking
      of: an incident that left him with more of the responsibility for his
      cooling. What Mr. Dosson wanted to know was how everything had struck him
      over there, especially the Pickett Building and the parlour-cars and
      Niagara and the hotels he had instructed him to go to, giving him an
      introduction in two or three cases to the gentleman in charge of the
      office. It was in relation to these themes that Gaston was guilty of a
      want of spring, as the girl phrased it to herself; that he could produce
      no appreciative expression. He declared however, repeatedly, that it was a
      most extraordinary country&mdash;most extraordinary and far beyond
      anything he had had any conception of. &ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t like
      EVERYTHING,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;any more than I like everything anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what didn&rsquo;t you like?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson enquired, at this, after a short
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaston Probert made his choice. &ldquo;Well, the light for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The light&mdash;the electric?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the solar! I thought it rather hard, too much like the scratching of
      a slate-pencil.&rdquo; As Mr. Dosson hereupon looked vague and rather as if the
      reference were to some enterprise (a great lamp company) of which he had
      not heard&mdash;conveying a suggestion that he was perhaps staying away
      too long, Gaston immediately added: &ldquo;I really think Francie might come in.
      I wrote to her that I wanted particularly to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and call her&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make her come,&rdquo; said Delia at the door.
      She left her companions together and Gaston returned to the subject of Mr.
      Munster, Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s former partner, to whom he had taken a letter and
      who had shown him every sort of civility. Mr. Dosson was pleased at this;
      nevertheless he broke out suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, you know; if you&rsquo;ve got anything to say that you don&rsquo;t think
      very acceptable you had better say it to ME.&rdquo; Gaston changed colour, but
      his reply was checked by Delia&rsquo;s quick return. She brought the news that
      her sister would be obliged if he would go into the little dining-room&mdash;he
      would find her there. She had something for his ear that she could mention
      only in private. It was very comfortable; there was a lamp and a fire.
      &ldquo;Well, I guess she CAN take care of herself!&rdquo; Mr. Dosson, at this,
      commented with a laugh. &ldquo;What does she want to say to him?&rdquo; he asked when
      Gaston had passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious knows! She won&rsquo;t tell me. But it&rsquo;s too flat, at his age, to live
      in such terror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such terror?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why of your father. You&rsquo;ve got to choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, to choose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why if there&rsquo;s a person you like and he doesn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you can&rsquo;t choose your father,&rdquo; said Mr. Dosson thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then please don&rsquo;t like any one. But perhaps <i>I</i> should like
      him,&rdquo; he added, faithful to his easier philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d have to,&rdquo; said Delia.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the small salle-a-manger, when Gaston went in, Francie was standing by
      the empty table, and as soon as she saw him she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t tell you I should do something. I did nothing else
      from the first&mdash;I mean but tell you. So you were warned again and
      again. You knew what to expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah don&rsquo;t say THAT again; if you knew how it acts on my nerves!&rdquo; the young
      man groaned. &ldquo;You speak as if you had done it on purpose&mdash;to carry
      out your absurd threat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what does it matter when it&rsquo;s all over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not all over. Would to God it were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what I sent for you to come in here for?
      To bid you good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held her an instant as if in unbelievable view, and then &ldquo;Francie, what
      on earth has got into you?&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;What deviltry, what poison?&rdquo; It
      would have been strange and sad to an observer, the opposition of these
      young figures, so fresh, so candid, so meant for confidence, but now
      standing apart and looking at each other in a wan defiance that hardened
      their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they despise me&mdash;don&rsquo;t they hate me? You do yourself!
      Certainly you&rsquo;ll be glad for me to break off and spare you decisions and
      troubles impossible to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand; it&rsquo;s like some hideous dream!&rdquo; Gaston Probert cried.
      &ldquo;You act as if you were doing something for a wager, and you make it worse
      by your talk. I don&rsquo;t believe it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What don&rsquo;t you believe?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you told him&mdash;that you told him knowingly. If you&rsquo;ll take that
      back (it&rsquo;s too monstrous!) if you&rsquo;ll deny it and give me your assurance
      that you were practised upon and surprised, everything can still be
      arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to lie?&rdquo; asked Francie Dosson. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like
      pleasant words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Francie, Francie!&rdquo; moaned the wretched youth with tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be arranged? What do you mean by everything?&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why they&rsquo;ll accept it; they&rsquo;ll ask for nothing more. It&rsquo;s your
      participation they can&rsquo;t forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THEY can&rsquo;t? Why do you talk to me of &lsquo;them&rsquo;? I&rsquo;m not engaged to &lsquo;them&rsquo;!&rdquo;
       she said with a shrill little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Francie <i>I</i> am! And it&rsquo;s they who are buried beneath that filthy
      rubbish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed at this characterisation of Mr. Flack&rsquo;s epistle, but returned
      as with more gravity: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry&mdash;very sorry indeed. But
      evidently I&rsquo;m not delicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, helpless and bitter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the newspapers in your
      country that would have made you so. Lord, they&rsquo;re too incredible! And the
      ladies have them on their tables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me we couldn&rsquo;t here&mdash;that the Paris ones are too bad,&rdquo; said
      Francie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad they are, God knows; but they&rsquo;ve never published anything like that&mdash;poured
      forth such a flood of impudence on decent quiet people who only want to be
      left alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie sank to a chair by the table as if she were too tired to stand
      longer, and with her arms spread out on the lamplit plush she looked up at
      him. &ldquo;Was it there you saw it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was on his feet opposite, and she made at this moment the odd reflexion
      that she had never &ldquo;realised&rdquo; he had such fine lovely uplifted eyebrows.
      &ldquo;Yes, a few days before I sailed. I hated them from the moment I got there&mdash;I
      looked at them very little. But that was a chance. I opened the paper in
      the hall of an hotel&mdash;there was a big marble floor and spittoons!&mdash;and
      my eyes fell on that horror. It made me ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think it was me?&rdquo; she patiently gaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as soon as I supposed it was my father. But I was too mystified,
      too tormented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you write to me, if you didn&rsquo;t think it was me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write to you? I wrote to you every three days,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I may have omitted a post at the last&mdash;I thought it might be
      Delia,&rdquo; Gaston added in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh she didn&rsquo;t want me to do it&mdash;the day I went with him, the day I
      told him. She tried to prevent me,&rdquo; Francie insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God then she had!&rdquo; he wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you told them she&rsquo;s delicate too?&rdquo; she asked in her strange tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer to this; he only continued: &ldquo;What power, in heaven&rsquo;s
      name, has he got over you? What spell has he worked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a gay old friend&mdash;he helped us ever so much when we were first
      in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dearest child, what &lsquo;gaieties,&rsquo; what friends&mdash;what a man to
      know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we hadn&rsquo;t known him we shouldn&rsquo;t have known YOU. Remember it was Mr.
      Flack who brought us that day to Mr. Waterlow&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;d have come some other way,&rdquo; said Gaston, who made nothing of
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. We knew nothing about any other way. He helped us in
      everything&mdash;he showed us everything. That was why I told him&mdash;when
      he asked me. I liked him for what he had done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaston, who had now also seated himself, listened to this attentively. &ldquo;I
      see. It was a kind of delicacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh a &lsquo;kind&rsquo;!&rdquo; She desperately smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained a little with his eyes on her face. &ldquo;Was it for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah how strange you are!&rdquo; he cried with tenderness. &ldquo;Such contradictions&mdash;on
      s&rsquo;y perd. I wish you&rsquo;d say that to THEM, that way. Everything would be
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wronged them, and nothing will ever
      be the same again. It was fatal. If I felt as they do I too would loathe
      the person who should have done such a thing. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me so bad&mdash;the
      thing in the paper; but you know best. You must go back to them. You know
      best,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were the last, the last people in France, to do it to. The sense of
      desecration, of pollution, you see&rdquo;&mdash;he explained as if for
      conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you needn&rsquo;t tell me&mdash;I saw them all there!&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been a dreadful scene. But you DIDN&rsquo;T brave them, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave them&mdash;what are you talking about? To you that idea&rsquo;s
      incredible!&rdquo; she then hopelessly sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he wouldn&rsquo;t have this. &ldquo;No, no&mdash;I can imagine cases.&rdquo; He clearly
      had SOME vision of independence, though he looked awful about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t a case, hey?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Well then go back to them&mdash;go
      back,&rdquo; she repeated. At this he half-threw himself across the table to
      seize her hands, but she drew away and, as he came nearer, pushed her
      chair back, springing up. &ldquo;You know you didn&rsquo;t come here to tell me you&rsquo;re
      ready to give them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give them up?&rdquo; He only echoed it with all his woe at first. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      battling with them till I&rsquo;m ready to drop. You don&rsquo;t know how they feel&mdash;how
      they MUST feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes I do. All this has made me older, every hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has made you&mdash;so extraordinarily!&mdash;more beautiful,&rdquo; said
      Gaston Probert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Nothing will induce me to consent to any sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some sacrifice there must be. Give me time&mdash;give me time, I&rsquo;ll
      manage it. I only wish they hadn&rsquo;t seen you there in the Bois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Bois?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Marguerite hadn&rsquo;t seen you&mdash;with that lying blackguard. That&rsquo;s
      the image they can&rsquo;t get over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was as if it had been the thing she had got herself most prepared
      for&mdash;so that she must speak accordingly. &ldquo;I see you can&rsquo;t either,
      Gaston. Anyhow I WAS there and I felt it all right. That&rsquo;s all I can say.
      You must take me as I am,&rdquo; said Francie Dosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t; you infuriate me!&rdquo; he pleaded, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seemed to soften, but she was in a sudden flame again. &ldquo;Of course
      I do, and I shall do it again. We&rsquo;re too terribly different. Everything
      makes you so. You CAN&rsquo;T give them up&mdash;ever, ever. Good-bye&mdash;good-bye!
      That&rsquo;s all I wanted to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and throttle him!&rdquo; the young man almost howled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, go! Good-bye.&rdquo; She had stepped quickly to the door and had
      already opened it, vanishing as she had done the other time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francie, Francie!&rdquo; he supplicated, following her into the passage. The
      door was not the one that led to the salon; it communicated with the other
      apartments. The girl had plunged into these&mdash;he already heard her
      push a sharp bolt. Presently he went away without taking leave of Mr.
      Dosson and Delia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why he acts just like Mr. Flack,&rdquo; said the old man when they discovered
      that the interview in the dining-room had come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was a bad one for Charles Waterlow, his work in the Avenue de
      Villiers being terribly interrupted. Gaston Probert invited himself to
      breakfast at noon and remained till the time at which the artist usually
      went out&mdash;an extravagance partly justified by the previous separation
      of several weeks. During these three or four hours Gaston walked up and
      down the studio while Waterlow either sat or stood before his easel. He
      put his host vastly out and acted on his nerves, but this easy genius was
      patient with him by reason of much pity, feeling the occasion indeed more
      of a crisis in the history of the troubled youth than the settlement of
      one question would make it. Waterlow&rsquo;s compassion was slightly tinged with
      contempt, for there was being settled above all, it seemed to him, and,
      alas, in the wrong sense, the question of his poor friend&rsquo;s character.
      Gaston was in a fever; he broke out into passionate pleas&mdash;he
      relapsed into gloomy silences. He roamed about continually, his hands in
      his pockets and his hair in a tangle; he could take neither a decision nor
      a momentary rest. It struck his companion more than ever before that he
      was after all essentially a foreigner; he had the foreign sensibility, the
      sentimental candour, the need for sympathy, the communicative despair. A
      true young Anglo-Saxon would have buttoned himself up in his embarrassment
      and been dry and awkward and capable, and, however conscious of a
      pressure, unconscious of a drama; whereas Gaston was effusive and
      appealing and ridiculous and graceful&mdash;natural above all and
      egotistical. Indeed a true young Anglo-Saxon wouldn&rsquo;t have known the
      particular acuteness of such a quandary, for he wouldn&rsquo;t have parted to
      such an extent with his freedom of spirit. It was the fact of this
      surrender on his visitor&rsquo;s part that excited Waterlow&rsquo;s secret scorn:
      family feeling was all very well, but to see it triumph as a superstition
      calling for the blood-sacrifice made him feel he would as soon be a
      blackamoor on his knees before a fetish. He now measured for the first
      time the root it had taken in Gaston&rsquo;s nature. To act like a man the hope
      of the Proberts must pull up the root, even if the operation should be
      terribly painful, should be attended with cries and tears and contortions,
      with baffling scruples and a sense of sacrilege, the sense of siding with
      strangers against his own flesh and blood. Now and again he broke out:
      &ldquo;And if you should see her as she looks just now&mdash;she&rsquo;s too lovely,
      too touching!&mdash;you&rsquo;d see how right I was originally, when I found her
      such a revelation of that rare type, the French Renaissance, you know, the
      one we talked about.&rdquo; But he reverted with at least equal frequency to the
      oppression he seemed unable to throw off, the idea of something done of
      cruel purpose and malice, with a refinement of outrage: such an accident
      to THEM, of all people on earth, the very last, the least thinkable, those
      who, he verily believed, would feel it more than any family in the world.
      When Waterlow asked what made them of so exceptionally fine a fibre he
      could only answer that they just happened to be&mdash;not enviably, if one
      would; it was his father&rsquo;s influence and example, his very genius, the
      worship of privacy and good manners, a hatred of all the new familiarities
      and profanations. The artist sought to know further, at last and rather
      wearily, what in two words was the practical question his friend desired
      he should consider. Whether he should be justified in throwing the girl
      over&mdash;was that the issue?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious goodness, no! For what sort of sneak do you take me? She made a
      mistake, but any innocent young creature might do that. It&rsquo;s whether it
      strikes you I should be justified in throwing THEM over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon the sense you attach to justification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean should I be miserably unhappy? Would it be in their power to make
      me so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To try&mdash;certainly, if they&rsquo;re capable of anything so nasty. The only
      fair play for them is to let you alone,&rdquo; Waterlow wound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, they won&rsquo;t do that&mdash;they like me too much!&rdquo; Gaston ingenuously
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an odd way of liking! The best way to show their love will be to let
      you marry where your affections, and so many other charming things, are
      involved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;only they question the charming things. They feel she
      represents, poor little dear, such dangers, such vulgarities, such
      possibilities of doing other dreadful things, that it&rsquo;s upon THEM&mdash;I
      mean on those things&mdash;my happiness would be shattered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the elder man rather dryly said, &ldquo;if you yourself have no secrets
      for persuading them of the contrary I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t teach you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I ought to do it myself,&rdquo; Gaston allowed in the candour of his
      meditations. Then he went on in his torment of hesitation: &ldquo;They never
      believed in her from the first. My father was perfectly definite about it.
      At heart they never accepted her; they only pretended to do so because I
      guaranteed her INSTINCTS&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I did, heaven help me! and that
      she was incapable of doing a thing that could ever displease them. Then no
      sooner was my back turned than she perpetrated that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was your folly,&rdquo; Waterlow remarked, painting away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My folly&mdash;to turn my back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;to guarantee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&mdash;and Gaston stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have thought her capable&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capabilissima! And I shouldn&rsquo;t have cared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think her then capable of breaking out again in some new way
      that&rsquo;s as bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care if she was. That&rsquo;s the least of all questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The least?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah don&rsquo;t you see, wretched youth,&rdquo; cried the artist, pausing from his
      work and looking up&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see that the question of her
      possibilities is as nothing compared to that of yours? She&rsquo;s the sweetest
      young thing I ever saw; but even if she happened not to be I should still
      urge you to marry her, in simple self-preservation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaston kept echoing. &ldquo;In self-preservation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save from destruction the last scrap of your independence. That&rsquo;s a
      much more important matter even than not treating her shabbily. They&rsquo;re
      doing their best to kill you morally&mdash;to render you incapable of
      individual life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaston was immensely struck. &ldquo;They are&mdash;they are!&rdquo; he declared with
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, if you believe it, for heaven&rsquo;s sake go and marry her
      to-morrow!&rdquo; Waterlow threw down his implements and added: &ldquo;And come out of
      this&mdash;into the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaston, however, was planted in his path on the way to the door. &ldquo;And if
      she goes again and does the very same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same&mdash;?&rdquo; Waterlow thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean something else as barbarous and as hard to bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Waterlow, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll at least have got rid of your family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if she lets me in again I shall be glad they&rsquo;re not there! They&rsquo;re
      right, pourtant, they&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Gaston went on, passing out of the studio
      with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was unimaginable that she should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank heaven! It was the finger of providence&mdash;providence
      taking you off your guard to give you your chance.&rdquo; This was ingenious,
      but, though he could glow for a moment in response to it, Francie&rsquo;s lover&mdash;if
      lover he may in his so infirm aspect be called&mdash;looked as if he
      mistrusted it, thought it slightly sophistical. What really shook him
      however was his companion&rsquo;s saying to him in the vestibule, when they had
      taken their hats and sticks and were on the point of going out: &ldquo;Lord,
      man, how can you be so impenetrably dense? Don&rsquo;t you see that she&rsquo;s really
      of the softest finest material that breathes, that she&rsquo;s a perfect flower
      of plasticity, that everything you may have an apprehension about will
      drop away from her like the dead leaves from a rose and that you may make
      of her any perfect and enchanting thing you yourself have the wit to
      conceive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah my dear friend!&rdquo;&mdash;and poor Gaston, with another of his
      revulsions, panted for gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The limit will be yours, not hers,&rdquo; Waterlow added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ve done with limits,&rdquo; his friend ecstatically cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening at ten o&rsquo;clock Gaston presented himself at the Hotel de
      l&rsquo;Univers et de Cheltenham and requested the German waiter to introduce
      him into the dining-room attached to Mr. Dosson&rsquo;s apartments and then go
      and tell Miss Francina he awaited her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;ll be better there than in the zalon&mdash;they&rsquo;ve villed it with
      their luccatch,&rdquo; said the man, who always addressed him in an intention of
      English and wasn&rsquo;t ignorant of the tie that united the visitor to the
      amiable American family, or perhaps even of the modifications it had
      lately undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With their luggage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They leave to-morrow morning&mdash;ach I don&rsquo;t think they themselves know
      for where, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please then say to Miss Francina that I&rsquo;ve called on the most urgent
      business and am extraordinarily pressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The special ardour possessing Gaston at that moment belonged to the order
      of the communicative, but perhaps the vividness with which the waiter
      placed this exhibition of it before the young lady is better explained by
      the fact that her lover slipped a five-franc piece into his hand. She at
      any rate entered his place of patience sooner than Gaston had ventured to
      hope, though she corrected her promptitude a little by stopping short and
      drawing back when she saw how pale he was and how he looked as if he had
      been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve chosen&mdash;I&rsquo;ve chosen,&rdquo; he said expressively, smiling at her in
      denial of these indications.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve chosen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to give them up. But I like it so better than having to give YOU
      up! I took you first with their assent. That was well enough&mdash;it was
      worth trying for. But now I take you without it. We can live that way
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah I&rsquo;m not worth it. You give up too much!&rdquo; Francie returned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
      going away&mdash;it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo; She averted herself quickly, as if to
      carry out her meaning, but he caught her more quickly still and held her&mdash;held
      her fast and long. She had only freed herself when her father and sister
      broke in from the salon, attracted apparently by the audible commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I thought you had at least knocked over the lamp!&rdquo; Delia exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take me with you if you&rsquo;re going away, Mr. Dosson,&rdquo; Gaston said.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start whenever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;where shall we go?&rdquo; that amiable man asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you decided that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the girls said they&rsquo;d tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were going home,&rdquo; Francie brought out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No we weren&rsquo;t&mdash;not a wee mite!&rdquo; Delia professed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh not THERE&rdquo; Gaston murmured, with a look of anguish at Francie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when you&rsquo;ve fixed it you can take the tickets,&rdquo; Mr. Dosson observed
      with detachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To some place where there are no newspapers, darling,&rdquo; Gaston went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll have hard work to find one,&rdquo; Mr. Dosson pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, we needn&rsquo;t read them any more. We wouldn&rsquo;t have read that one if
      your family hadn&rsquo;t forced us,&rdquo; Delia said to her prospective
      brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall never be forced&mdash;I shall never again in my life look
      at one,&rdquo; he very gravely declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see, sir,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to!&rdquo; Mr. Dosson cheerfully persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll tell us enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francie had kept her eyes on the ground; the others were all now rather
      unnaturally smiling. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they forgive me ever?&rdquo; she asked, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, perfectly, if you can persuade me not to stick to you. But in that
      case what good will their forgiveness do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s better to pay for it,&rdquo; the girl went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pay for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By suffering something. For it WAS dreadful,&rdquo; she solemnly gloomily said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh for all you&rsquo;ll suffer&mdash;!&rdquo; Gaston protested, shining down on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was for you&mdash;only for you, as I told you,&rdquo; Francie returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t tell me again&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like that explanation! I ought to
      let you know that my father now declines to do anything for me,&rdquo; the young
      man added to Mr. Dosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do anything for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make me any allowance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that makes me feel better. We don&rsquo;t want your father&rsquo;s money, you
      know,&rdquo; this more soothable parent said with his mild sturdiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be enough for all; especially if we economise in newspapers&rdquo;&mdash;Delia
      carried it elegantly off.

      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, after all&mdash;the Reverberator came for nothing,&rdquo;
       her father as gaily returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be afraid he&rsquo;ll ever send it now!&rdquo; she shouted in her return of
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry&mdash;because they were all lovely,&rdquo; Francie went on to
      Gaston with sad eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us wait to say that till they come back to us,&rdquo; he answered somewhat
      sententiously. He really cared little at this moment whether his relatives
      were lovely or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t have to wait long!&rdquo; Delia remarked with the same
      cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Till they come back&rsquo;?&rdquo; Mr. Dosson repeated. &ldquo;Ah they can&rsquo;t come back
      now, sir. We won&rsquo;t take them in!&rdquo; The words fell from his lips with a fine
      unexpected austerity which imposed itself, producing a momentary silence,
      and it is a sign of Gaston&rsquo;s complete emancipation that he didn&rsquo;t in his
      heart resent this image of eventual favours denied his race. The
      resentment was rather Delia&rsquo;s, but she kept it to herself, for she was
      capable of reflecting with complacency that the key of the house would
      after all be hers, so that she could open the door for the Proberts if the
      Proberts should knock. Now that her sister&rsquo;s marriage was really to take
      place her consciousness that the American people would have been
      resoundingly told so was still more agreeable. The party left the Hotel de
      l&rsquo;Univers et de Cheltenham on the morrow, but it appeared to the German
      waiter, as he accepted another five-franc piece from the happy and now
      reckless Gaston, that they were even yet not at all clear as to where they
      were going.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
